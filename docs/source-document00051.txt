_EDITOR'S NOTE._

The reader will perceive that the foregoing list of the dead reports only those who had died
"since April last" (1622), consequently does not include the victims of the Indian massacre,
which occurred on the 22d of March of that year. The number which fell by that diabolical conspiracy,
as reported by Smith, amounted to 347, and in his Generall Historie, at page 149, he has a
list of the numbers murdered at different places. Neill copies from the Records of the Virginia
Company (now in the Congressional Library at Washington) a list of their names--see his "History
of the Virginia Company," pp. 339-346--and considering that it is proper to annex this to the
list preceding we herewith give it. The total corresponds with the statement in Smith's Historie.

The number of deaths in the census list shows a mortality amounting in one year to upwards
of twenty per cent. of the whole population, exceeding the number which fell in the massacre
by twenty-four. The fullest details of this and many other matters relating to the Colony while
under the Virginia Company, can be found more fully shown in Neill's History of the Virginia
Company than in any other work we have seen.

"Here following is set downe a true list of the names of all those that were massacred by the
treachery of the Sauages in Virginia, the 22^{nd} March last.

"To the end that their lawfull heyres may take speedy order for the inheritinge of their lands
and estates there. For which the honourable Company of Virginia are ready to do them all right

A BRIEFE DECLARATION OF THE PLANTATION OF VIRGINIA

DURINGE THE FIRST TWELVE YEARES, WHEN SIR THOMAS SMITH WAS GOVERNOR OF THE COMPANIE, & DOWNE
TO THIS PRESENT TYME.

BY THE

ANCIENT PLANTERS NOWE REMAINING ALIVE IN VIRGINIA.

1624.

PREFACE.

The next paper presented in this collection is a copy of the one from which Mr. Bancroft quotes
in his introductory note to the meeting of the first Assembly, referring to it as "MS. in my
possession." This is printed from the copy among the McDonald papers, and with its title and
endorsements no intimation is given as to the date of its preparation, its author or authors,
to whom it was addressed, or the use intended to be made of it. These questions are, however,
answered almost entirely by reference to the entries in "Sainsbury's Calendar of State Papers,"
which, on pp. 65-'6, has the following: "1624. July. Petition of Gov. Sir Francis Wyatt, the
Council and Assembly of Virginia to the King. Have understood that his Majesty, notwithstanding
the unjust disparagement of the Plantation, has taken it under his especial care; intreat that
credit may not be given to the late declarations presented to his Majesty concerning the happy,
but indeed miserable, estate of the Colony during the first twelve years (of Sir Thos. Smith's
government), nor to the malicious imputations which have been laid upon the late government.
Inclose the true state of both, and earnestly request that the present government may be continued.
Pray that the King's tender compassion will not allow them to fall into the hands of Sir Thos.
Smith or his confidents." Signed by Sir Fran. Wyatt, Capt. Fan. West, Sir George Yeardley and
eighty-six others. _Inclose._--"Brief Declaration of the Plantation," &c., giving the whole
title of this paper, verbatim, and a copious abstract of its contents. The earliest account
of the horrors it relates is to be found in Smith's History, p. 105, in what is called "the
examinations of Doctor Simons." This writer gives full details of the straits to which the
Colonists were reduced and the expedients to which they resorted to appease hunger in 1609;
adding, after the statements in regard to eating the Indian who had been buried several days
and their eating "one another boyled, and stewed with rootes and herbes," the account of the
man who "did kill his wife, powdered her, and had eaten part of her before it was known," and
adding with a grim humour, "now whether shee was better roasted, boyled or carbonado'd, I know
not, but of such a dish as powdered wife, I never heard of." His statements are copied, with
more or less variation, by Beverley, Stith, Keith and Burke, but not one of them go into the
disgusting and improbable details named in the "Brief Declaration." Campbell also reports the
stories, but adds, in regard to the wife murderer, "upon his trial it appeared that cannibalism
was feigned to palliate the murder," p. 93. Neill quotes from the Records of the Virginia Company,
"The Tragical Relation of Virginia Assembly," which was transmitted to England about 1621;
this was intended as a reply to a petition of Alderman Johnson and others, who had represented
to the King that the reports in regard to Sir Thos. Smith's management were false, and desiring
an investigation. These petitioners were members of a faction which desired to break up the
Virginia Company. In the Relation of the Assembly, Smith is charged with all the cruelties
to the Colonists which are mentioned in this "Brief Declaration"; torturing and starving to
death being the punishments for minor offences; and asserting their confidence in the truth
of these statements by concluding it with these words: "And rather to be reduced to live under
the like government we desire his Ma^{ties} commissioners may be sent over w^{th} authoritie
to hange us." This is signed by thirty members of the General Assembly, including among the
names, those of George Sandys, the poet, traveller and Secretary of the Colony, and Raph Hamor,
the chronicler--See Neill, pp. 407-411.

There is another reference to this starving time (as it is called) and its accompanying horror,
which should not be allowed to pass without notice. As above stated, the worst state of affairs
was reported to have existed in 1609, and in the next year a pamphlet with the following title
was issued, "A true declaration of the estate of the Colonie of Virginia, with a refutation
of such scandalous reports as haue tended to the disgrace of so worthy an enterprise. Published
by aduise and direction of the Councell of Virginia. London, 1610." The writer of which, after
referring to the slanders which had been circulated in regard to Sir Thos. Smith's government,
and especially of the story of the wife-eater, says, "Sir Thomas Gates thus relateth the tragedie,"
and then follows a long passage to the effect that "one of the companie mortally hated his
wife," and having killed her and secreted her body after cutting it into peices; when it was
found out he said she died and he had hid her to satiafie his hunger, and had fed daily upon
her, but upon searching his house they found a large quantity of provisions.--See Force's tracts,
Vol. III. The writers of the "Brief Declaration," and the "True Declaration," must have seen
this statement published ten or twelve years before they wrote, and it is a little remarkable
that they should have persisted in repeating a story which was far from being well authentitcated,
especially as the true statement did not need this addition to increase the odium incurred
by the mismanagement of Sir Thos. Smith, the evidences of which are herein set forth.

Stith reports the stories of the Indian "that had been slain and buried" being taken up and
eaten, and "so did several others, one another that died," and also that of the man who "killed
his wife and powdered her up, and eat the greater portion before it was discovered;" and adds,
for many years after it was "remembered by the name of the _starving time_," p. 116-117. For
many particulars nowhere else given, see Neill's History, pp. 407-411.

STATE PAPER OFFICE.    } COLONIAL.              } _Volume 3, No. 21, I._ }

     A BREIFE DECLARATION _of the Plantation of Virginia duringe the
     first Twelve Yeares, when Sir Thomas Smith was Governor of the
     Companie, & downe to this present tyme. By the Ancient Planters
     nowe remaining alive in Virginia._

Wheras in the beginninge of Sir Thomas Smith's twelve yeares government, it was published in
printe throughout the Kingdome of Englande that a Plantation should be settled in Virginia
for the glorie of God in the propogation of the Gospell of Christ, the conversion of the Savages,
to the honour of his Majesty, by the enlargeinge of his territories and future enrichinge of
his kingdome, for which respects many noble & well minded persons were induced to adventure
great sums of money to the advancement of soe pious & noble a worke, who have from the very
first been frustrate of their expectation, as wee conceive, by the misgovernment of Sir Thomas
Smith, aiminge at nothinge more then a perticular gaine, to be raised out of the labours of
such as both voluntarilie adventured themselves and were otherwise sent over at the common
charge. This will cleerely appeare in the examination of the first expedition & severall supplies
in the tyme of his government.

The first Plantation in Virginia consisted of one hundred persons, so slenderly provided for
that before they had remained halfe a yeare in this new Collony they fell into extreame want,
not havinge anything left to sustein them save a little ill conditioned Barley, which ground
to meal & pottage made thereof, one smale ladle full was allowed each person for a meale, without
bread or aught else whatsoever, so that had not God, by his great providence, moved the Indians,
then our utter enemies, to bringe us reliefe, we had all utterlie by famine perished. How unable
so small a companye of people, soe poorely sent over, were to make way for such as shoulde
followe, may easily be judged.

The first supplie beinge two shippes, the John & Francis & Phenix, with one hundred & twenty
persons, worse every way provided for then the former, arrived heere about eight or nine months
after & found the Collony consistinge of no more then forty persons (of those) tenn only able
men, the rest at point of death, all utterly destitute of howses, not one as yet built, so
that they lodged in cabbins & holes within the grounde; victualls they had none, save some
small reliefe from the Indians, as some yet living weare feelinge witnesses, neither were we
for our future and better maintenance permitted to manure or till any grounde, a thing in a
new Plantation principally to be regarded, but weare by the direction of Sir Thomas Smith,
and his officers heere, wholly imployed in cuttinge downe of masts, cedar, blacke wallnutt,
clapboarde, &c., and in digginge gould oare (as some thought) which beinge sent for England
proved dirt. These works to make retorne of present proffit hindered others of more necessary
consequence of Plantation.

After this first supplie there were some few poore howses built, & entrance made in cleeringe
of grounde to the quantitye of foure acres for the wholl Collony, hunger & sickness not permitting
any great matters to bee donne that yeare.

The second supplie was a ship called the Mary Margett, which arrived here nine months after,
about the time of Michaellmas, in her sixty persons, most gentlemen, few or no tradesmen, except
some Polanders to make Pitch, tarre, potashes, &c., to be retorned for present gaine, soe meanly
likewise were these furnished forth for victualles, that in lesse then two monthes after their
arrivall, want compelled us to imploye our time abroad in trading with the Indians for corne;
whereby though for a time we partly relieved our necessities, yet in Maye followinge we weare
forced (leavinge a small guarde of gentlemen & some others about the president at James Towne)
to disperse the wholl Collony, some amongst the Salvadges but most to the Oyster Banks, where
they lived uppon oysters for the space of nine weekes, with the allowance only of a pinte of
Indian corne to each man for a week, & that allowance of corne continued to them but two weekes
of the nine, which kinde of feeding caused all our skinns to peele off, from head to foote,
as if we had beene flead. By this time arrived Captaine Samuell Argall in a small Barque, with
him neither supplie of men nor victualls from the Company; but we understandinge that he had
some small provisions of bread and wine, more then would serve his owne companie, required
him and the master of the Barque to remaine ashoare whilst we might bring his sailes ashoare
the better to assure us of his ship & such provisions as coulde be spared, whereunto he seemed
willingly to condescend. Those provisions, at a small allowance of Biskett, cake, and a small
measure of wine or beere to each person for a Daye some what relieved us for the space of a
month, at the end of which time arrived the thirde supplie, called Sir Thomas Gates, his fleet,
which consisted of seaven shippes & neere five hundred persons with whom a small proportion
of victuall, for such a number, was landed; howses few or none to entertain them, so that being
quartered in the open feilde they fell uppon that small quantitye of corne, not beinge above
seaven acres, which we with great penury & sufferance had formerly planted, and in three days,
at the most, wholly devoured it.
