SPRING, ETC.

Our ancestors had three verbs and three corresponding substantives to express the growth of
plants, namely, _spring_, _shoot_, and _sprout_,--all indicative of rapidity of growth; for
_sprout_, (Germ. _spriessen_) is akin to _spurt_, and denotes quickness, suddenness. The only
one of these which remains in general use is _shoot_: for _sprout_ is now only appropriated
to the young growth from cabbage-stalks; and _spring_ is heard no more save in _sprig_, which
is evidently a corruption of it, and which now denotes a small slip or twig as we say, sprigs
of laurel, bay, thyme, mint, rosemary, &c.

Of the original meaning of _spring_, I have met but one clear instance; it is, however, an
incontrovertible one, namely,

    "Whoso spareth the _spring_ (_i. e._ rod, switch), spilleth his
    children."--_Visions of Piers Plowman_, v. 2554., ed. Wright.

Perhaps this is also the meaning in--

                 "Shall, Antipholus,
  Even in the spring of love thy _love-springs_ rot?"
                  _Com. of Errors_, Act III. Sc. 2.

and in "Time's Glory"--

 "To dry the old oak's sap and cherish _springs_."
                  _Rape of Lucrece._

_Spring_ afterwards came to be used for underwood, &c. Perhaps it answered to the present _coppice_,
which is composed of the springs or shoots of the growth which has been cut down:

 "The lofty high wood and the lower _spring_."
                  Drayton's _Muses' Elysium_, 10.

 "The lesser birds that keep the lower _spring_."
                  _Id._, note.

It was also used as equivalent to grove:

                 "Unless it were
  The nightingale among the thick-leaved _spring_."
                  Fletcher's _Faith. Shep._, v. 1.

where, however, it may be the coppice.

 "This hand Sibylla's golden boughs to guard them,
  Through hell and horror, to the Elysian _springs_."
                  Massinger's _Bondman_, ii. 1.

In the following place Fairfax uses _spring_ to express the "salvatichi soggiorni," i. e. _selva_
of his original:

 "But if his courage any champion move
  Too try the hazard of this dreadful _spring_."
                  _Godf. of Bull._, xiii. 31.

and in

 "For you alone to happy end must bring
  The strong enchantments of the charmed _spring_."
                  _Id._, xviii. 2.

it answers to _selva_.

When Milton makes his Eve say--

                 "While I
  In yonder _spring_ of roses intermix'd
  With _myrtles_ find what to redress till noon."
                  _Par. Lost_, ix. 217.

he had probably in his mind the _cespuglio_ in the first canto of the _Orlando Furioso_; for
_spring_ had not been used in the sense of thickets, clumps, by any previous English poet.
I am of opinion that _spring_ occurs for the last time in our poetry in the following lines
of Pope:

 "See thy bright altars throng'd with prostrate kings,
  And heap'd with products of Sabæan _springs_."
                  _Messiah_, 93.

Johnson renders the last line--

 "Cinnameos cumulos, Nabathæi munera _veris_;"

and this is probably the sense in which the place has generally been understood. But let any
one read the preceding quotations, and reflect on what a diligent student Pope was of the works
of his predecessors, and perhaps he will think with me.

SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.

_The Passage in King Henry VIII., Act III. Sc._ 1. (Vol. vii., pp. 5. 111. 183. 494.).--MR.
INGLEBY has done perfectly right to "call me to account" for a rash and unadvised assertion,
in saying that we must interpolate _been_ in the passage in _King Henry VIII._, Act III. Sc.
2., after _have_; for even that would not make it intelligible. So far I stand corrected. The
passages, however that are cited, are not parallel cases. In the first we have the word _loyalty_
to complete the sense:

 "    .    .    .    .    .   My loyalty,
  Which ever has [been] and ever shall be growing."

In the second, the word _deserved_ is clearly pointed out as being understood, from the occurrence
of _deserve_ after _will_:

"I have spoken better of you than you have [deserved] or will deserve at my hands."

I will assist MR. INGLEBY'S position with another example from _Rich. II._, Act V. Sc. 5.:

 "    .    .    .    .    .   like silly beggars,
  Who sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame,
  That many have [sat] and others must sit there."

And even from a much later writer, Bolingbroke:

    "This dedication may serve for almost any book that has, is, or shall
    be published."

Where we must supply _been_ after _has_. But in the passage I attempted, and I think successfully,
to set right, admitting that custom would allow of the ellipsis of the participle _been_, after
the auxiliary _have_, to what can "am, have, and will be" possibly refer?

 "    .    .    .    .    .   I do professe
  That for your highness' good, I euer labour'd
  More then mine owne, that am, haue, and will be."

What? Add _true_ at the end of the line, and it mars the verse, but make the probable correction
of _true_ for _haue_, and you get excellent sense without any ellipsis. I am as averse to interpolation
or alteration of the text, when sense can by any rational supposition be made of it, as my
opponent, or any true lover of the poet and the integrity of his language, can possibly be;
but I see nothing rational in refusing to correct an almost self-evident misprint, which would
redeem a fine passage that otherwise must always remain a stumbling-block to the most intelligent
reader. We have all I trust but one object, _i. e._ to free the text of our great poet from
obvious errors occasioned by extremely incorrect printing in the folios, and at the same time
to strictly watch over all attempts at its corruption by unnecessary meddling. This, and not
the displaying of our own ingenuity in conjectures, ought to be our almost sacred duty; at
least, I feel conscious that it is mine.

 "That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain."
                  _Hamlet_.

The notable quotation of this line by the Earl of Derby, in the Lords, on Monday evening, April
25, has once more reminded me of my unanswered Query respecting it, Vol. vi., p. 270.

On the 26th February (Vol. vii., p. 217.) MR. COLLIER was good enough to say, that his only
{450} reason for not answering it was, that he had not then within his reach the copy of "N.
& Q." wherein it had been proposed; politely adding, that if I would reprint the Query, he
would at once answer it.

Supposing, however, that MR. COLLIER'S absence from his library would be only temporary, I
deemed it less troublesome to the Editor of "N. & Q." to wait until MR. COLLIER could refer
to the Query, as already printed.

Two months have since elapsed, and I now no longer hesitate to ask the Editor for an opportunity
of again referring to it, trusting that a sufficient excuse will be found in the importance
of the subject, as affecting the fundamental sense of a passage in Shakspeare.

_Mr. J. Payne Collier's "Notes and Emendations."_--There can be no doubt that many of these
emendations are rational and judicious; but I cannot help thinking, _on the whole_, that MR.
COLLIER has rather overrated their value, and placed too implicit faith in the infallibility
of his unknown guide. At all events, there is not a shadow of authority given for any one of
the corrections, and we have therefore a full right to try them, as the lawyers would say,
"upon the merits;" or, in other words, to treat them as mere speculative alterations, and to
adopt or reject them, as may appear advisable in each particular case. It is difficult to conjecture
what can have been the position in life, or the occupation of this mysterious annotator. That
his pursuits were not purely literary, I think is plain: first, from the very circumstance
of his not authenticating any of his notes, which a literary inquirer would certainly have
done; and, secondly, from the very minute attention which is paid to the _business_ of the
scene and the movements of the actors. These considerations, coupled with the fact of his frequently
striking out whole passages of the text (which a literary enthusiast would _not_ have done),
would at first lead us to suppose that the writer was a theatrical manager, and that the alterations
were made to suit either the fancies, or perhaps the peculiar qualifications of certain performers.
But in this case one can hardly suppose that the remarks would have extended to more than a
certain number of plays, which were most frequently acted. Thus much, however, appears certain,
that the commentaries are rather those of an _habitual play-goer_, than of a studious critic;
and it will be easy to show that a great portion of the new readings he proposes are really
changes _for the worse_, while a still larger number are at least unnecessary! I shall content
myself with only a few instances, on this occasion, as I am unwilling to encroach too far on
your space; but I can easily multiply them, if I am encouraged to renew the subject.

In the first place, I differ from MR. COLLIER entirely as to the famous passage from _Henry
VIII._, p. 324., which he brings so prominently forward as to give it special notice in his
Introduction. To me, I confess, the phrase--

 "To steal from spiritual _labour_ a brief span,"

appears quite tame and poor in comparison with

 "To steal from spiritual _leisure_ a brief span,"

and, moreover, destroys all the poetry of the thought. Nor can I see the slightest difficulty
in the _sense_ of the original passage. The king means to say that Wolsey cannot steal from
the _little leisure_ afforded him by his spiritual labours "a brief span, to keep his earthly
audit:" and surely this is much more poetical than the substituted passage.

In p. 323., from the same play, we have--

 "to the sharp'st _kind_ of justice,"

transformed to "sharp'st _knife_ of justice:" but I cannot assent to this change. The obvious
meaning of the poet is, that the contempt of the world, "_shutting all doors_" against the
accused, is a sharper _kind_ of justice than any which the law could inflict: but, to be given
up to "the sharp'st _knife_ of justice" could only mean, being consigned to the public executioner,--which
was just what Katherine was deprecating.

In p. 325. the lines relating to Wolsey's foundations at Ipswich and Oxford are printed thus
in the folio--

                 "one of which fell with him,
  Unwilling to outlive the good that did it:"

that is, unwilling to outlive the virtues which prompted it,--a passage teeming with poetical
feeling: but the commentator has ruthlessly altered it to--

 "Unwilling to outlive the _good man_ did it;"

which, I submit, not only destroys all the poetry, but is decidedly _not English!_

The next passage I would notice is from _Much Ado about Nothing_, p. 76. How, I would ask,
can the phrase--

 "And sorrow wag,"

be a misprint for "call sorrow joy?" No compositor, or scribe either, could possibly be misled
by any sound from the "reader" into such a mistake as that! The words "and sorrow wag," I admit,
are not sense; but the substitution of "call sorrow joy" strikes me as bald and common-place
in the extreme, and there is no pretence for its having any authority. If, then, we are to
have a mere fanciful emendation, why not "bid sorrow wag?" This would be doing far less violence
to the printed text, for it would only require the alteration of two letters in the word "and;"
while it would preserve the Shakspearian character of the passage. "Wag" is a favourite expression
in {451} the comedies of the Bard, and occurs repeatedly in his works. The passage would then
run thus--

 "If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
  _Bid sorrow wag_--cry hem! when he should groan."

In p. 73. we find--

 "Soul-tainted flesh," &c.

substituted for "_foul_ tainted flesh;" and we are told that the critics have been all wrong,
who supposed that Shakspeare intended any "metaphor from the kitchen!" If so, what meaning
can be attached to the line--

 "And salt too little which may season give?"

If that is not a metaphor from the kitchen, I know not what could be? I still believe that
"foul tainted flesh" is the correct reading. The expression "_soul_-tainted flesh" is not intelligible.
It should rather be "_soul-tainting_ flesh." The _soul_ may be tainted by the _flesh_: but
how the _flesh_ can be _soul-tainted_, I cannot understand.

Turning further back, to p. 69., we find it asserted, quite dogmatically, that the word "truths"
of the folios ought to be "proofs;" but no reason whatever is offered for the change. I cannot
help thinking that "seeming _truths_" is much the most poetical expression, while in "seeming
_proofs_" there is something like redundancy,--to say nothing of the phrase being infinitely
more common-place!

In the play of the _Tempest_, p. 4., the beautiful passage--

                 "he being thus _lorded_
  Not only with what my revenue yielded," &c.,

is degraded into "he being thus _loaded_," &c. Can there be a moment's doubt that "lorded"
was the word used by Shakspeare? It is completely in his style, which was on all occasions
to coin verbs out of substantives, if he could. "He being thus _lorded_," i. e. _ennobled_
"with what my revenue yielded," is surely a far superior expression to "being thus _loaded_,"--as
if the poet were speaking of a costermonger's donkey!

Again, in p. 10.:

 "Wherefore _this_ ghastly looking?"

or, this ghastly appearance? Who will venture to say, that the substitution of "_thus ghastly_
looking" is not decidedly a change for the worse?

In the Merchant of Venice, p. 118.:

 "and leave itself _unfurnished_,"

is altered to "leave itself _unfinished_!" I confess I cannot see the slightest warrant for
this change. The words--

                 "having made one,
  Methinks IT should have power to steal _both his_,"

distinctly show that the author was alluding to the _eye_ only, and not to the _portrait_ and
how could the eye (already _made_) describe itself as _unfinished_? Surely the sense is _unfurnished_,
that is, _unfurnished_ with its companion, or probably with the other accessories required
to complete the portrait.

P. 119. has the line--

 "And swearing 'til my very _roof_ was dry,"

transmogrified into--

 "And swearing 'til my very _tongue_ was dry."

Now, why "this lame and impotent conclusion?" What can be a more common expression than the
"roof of the mouth?" and it is just the part which is most affected by a sensation of dryness
and pricking, after any excitement in speaking, whereas the _tongue_ is not the member that
suffers!

In _As You Like It_, p. 127., in the line--

 "Mistress dispatch you with your _safest haste_,"

the last two words are made "fastest haste," which, to say the least, are tautology, and are
like talking, of the "highest height", or the the "deepest depth!" Surely, the original form
of words, "Dispatch you with your _safest haste_;" that is, with as much haste as is consistent
with your personal safety--is much more dignified and polished address from the duke to a _lady_,
and at the same time more poetical!

In p. 129.,

 "The constant _service_ of the antique world,"

is converted into

 "The constant _favour_ of the antique world:"

in which line I cannot discover any sense. If I might hazard a guess, I should suggest that
the error is in the _second_ word, "service," and that it ought to be "servants:"

 "When _servants_ sweat for duty, not for meed."
