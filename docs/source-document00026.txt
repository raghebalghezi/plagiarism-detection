"MELBA not here to play _Elsa_!" exclaims Sir DRURIOLANUS, immediately adding, with that wit
which is always, like the British Tar, 'Ready, aye ready!'--"then we must get somebody Else
Sir!" and scarcely had the words escaped his lips, than Madame NORDICA, who happened to be
passing by, sang out in an extempore recitative, "_Me voici!_" "_Bravissima!_" cried Sir DRURIOLANUS.
"Saved! Saved!" General dance of joy.

So the Curtain was rung up, and the Opera, with Madame NORDICA (_vice_ MELBA) as _Elsa_, and
VAN DYCK (_vice_ Little JOHNNIE THE RISKY) as _Lohengrin_, made a big success. House crowded.
All's well that ends as well as this.

_Tuesday with Mozart._--What a good starting idea for a Comic Opera would be the notion of
making those two types of knaves, _Leporello_ and _Figaro_, meet as counter-plotters. Monsieur
MAUREL suggests a step in this direction, when one night he impersonates the gay Spanish Don,
and on another he appears as the roguish Italian barber, no longer an intriguing bachelor but
a jealous bridegroom. Merry Melodious MOZART! Old-fashioned he may be, like not a few of the
best melodies and the best stories. Elegant Countess is Madame EMMA EAMES. Can she possibly
ever have been _Rosina_, _Dr. Bartolo's_ tricky ward! What a change matrimony makes in some
folks! Old _Dr. Bartolo_ bears not much resemblance to the other _Dr. Bartolo_, and _Don Basilio_,
a kind of Ecclesiastical lawyer, is quite a rollicking wag as compared with the _Basilio_ of
the Barber of Seville. Nothing could be better than the _Susanna_ of Mlle. TELEKI, or sweeter
than the duet, heartily encored, between her and the _Countess_. EDOUARD DE RESZKÉ is a magnificent
representative of the gloomily-jealous Count, who, having once been the gayest of the gay,
still retains something of his old sly-boots character in private. He is always going wrong,
and always being in the wrong when found out: a Count quite at a discount, for whom there will
perhaps be no rest until he is "par." with a family. Needless to say, the part was well acted
and sung by Brother NED, whom a gentleman near me, who "knew all about it," mistook for his
brother JOHN, and criticised accordingly. As _Cherubino_, Mlle. SIGRID ARNOLDSON is a delightfully
boyish scapegrace, giving us just that _soupçon_ of natural awkwardness which a spoilt sunny
Southern lad of sixteen, brought up in such mixed society as is represented by _Count Almaviva's_
household, would occasionally show when more than usually "spoony." Mlle. ARNOLDSON sings MOZART
pure and simple, without interpolating cadenzas, roulades, nourishes, or exercises of musical
fireworks, and the audience rewarded her artistically simple rendering of "_Voi che sapete_"
with an _encore_, which was as hearty as it was well-deserved. Capital House. Parliamentary
musicians conspicuous by their absence. Ex-M.P.'s represented in a body by Sir H-NRY EDW-RDS
the evergreen.

It was reported in the House--the Opera House--that Sir DRURIOLANUS was standing; but for what
Constituency, was not mentioned. The rumour was justified by his appearing at the Stall entrance,
where he stood for some time, but as he finely observed, "I am not in search of a seat--in
Parliament. No! Let who will make the people's laws, give me the bringing out for them of their
Operas and Pantomimes." So saying, he bowed gracefully to nobody in particular (who happened
to be talking to him), and, with a refreshing wave of the hand, Sir DRURIOLANUS was wafted
away into the offing, and "lost to sight," while still "to memory dear."

_Trumpet Note in advance._--_The Trompeter of Sakkingen_ is announced as "in active preparation."
Needless to say more, as, of course, he blows his own trumpet for himself. The question is,
will it be a big trump in the hand of Sir DRURIOLANUS?

_Saturday._--_Elaine_ changed her mind, and wouldn't come out to-night.

NEW RENDERING OF "CONSULE PLANCO"--"CONSULT PLANCHETTE."--If "Planchette" can give such accurate
information as it appears to have done at Mr. CHARLES WYNDHAM's supper-party, and elsewhere,
as recounted in the _Daily Telegraph_, why is it not at once put into general requisition?
Why is there any Parliamentary debating? Why not use "Planchette?" Why run any chance of losing
on a race, but simply "ask Planchette?" Only, by the way, if this were universal, and if everyone
is to win, who is to lose? Thus Planchette would put an end to nearly all speculation. Planchette
would inaugurate a new era of complete and unqualified success. No doubt Mr. CHARLES WYNDHAM
consulted Planchette before producing _The Fringe of Society_, and is in consequence being
amply rewarded for placing his trust in Planchette. Failure would be impossible except to the
obstinate few who should persistently refuse to pin their faith on the utterances of "Planchette."
But, suppose after doing enough to establish her reputation, "Planchette," being feminine and
therefore "_varium et mutabile semper_," should suddenly deceive her followers, as did _Zamiel's_
seventh charmed bullet (which ought always to have been kept up _Caspar's_ sleeve--but _Caspar_
was an idiot), and the Weird but Larky Sisters who captivated _Macbeth_?

"Trust her not, she's fooling thee, Beware! Beware!" and Planchette, the little plank, will
make more of her followers "plank down" than pick up gold and silver.

"DEAREST CHUCK!"--_SHAKSPEARE._

"_Mr. G._" (_to the Ardent Female Supporter, henceforth to be historically known as "The Gingerbread-nut-Chucker"_):--

  'Twas all very well to dissemble your love,
  But why chuck the nut in my eye?

    [_Mr. G. is aware that the Divine WILLIAMS has spoken of
    ginger as "hot in the mouth," but Mr. G. says "he got it
    uncommonly hot in the eye."_]
