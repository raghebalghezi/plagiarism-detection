CLAVERHOUSE.

CHAPTER I.

John Graham, Viscount of Dundee, best known, perhaps, in history by his territorial title of
Claverhouse, was born in the year 1643. No record, indeed, exists either of the time or place
of his birth, but a decision of the Court of Session seems to fix the former in that year--the
year, as lovers of historical coincidences will not fail to remark, of the Solemn League and
Covenant.[1]

He came of an ancient and noble stock. The family of Graham can be traced back in unbroken
succession to the beginning of the twelfth century; and indeed there have been attempts to
encumber its scutcheon with the quarterings of a fabulous antiquity. Gram, we are told, was
in some primeval time the generic name for all independent leaders of men, and was borne by
one of the earliest kings of Denmark. Another has surmised that if Graham be the proper spelling
of the name, it may be compounded of Gray and Ham, the dwelling, or home, of Gray; but if Grame,
or Græme, be the correct form, then we must regard it as a genuine Saxon word, signifying fierce,
or grim. Such exercises are ingenious, and to some minds, possibly, interesting; but they are
surely in this case superfluous. A pedigree, says Scott laughingly as he sits down to trace
his own, is the national prerogative of every Scottishman, as unalienable as his pride and
poverty; but he must be very poor or very proud who cannot find his account in the legitimate
pedigree of the House of Montrose.

The first of the branch of Claverhouse, which took its name from a small town in Forfarshire
a few miles to the north of Dundee, was John, son of John Graham of Balargus in the same shire.
Graham of Balargus was the son of another John, who was the second son of Sir Robert Graham
of Fintrey, the eldest son of Robert Graham of Strathcanon, son and heir of Sir William Graham
of Kincardine, by his wife the Lady Mary Stuart, widow of George first Earl of Angus and daughter
of King Robert the Third--the unhappy king of "The Fair Maid of Perth." The grandson of John
Graham was Sir William Graham of Claverhouse, the chosen friend of his cousin, the gallant
and unfortunate Marquis of Montrose. By his wife Marion, daughter of Thomas Fotheringham of
Powrie, Sir William had two sons, George and Walter, of whom the latter was the ancestor of
those Grahams of Duntroon who at a later period assumed the title of Dundee. George left one
son, another Sir William, who married Lady Jean Carnegie, daughter of the first Earl of Northesk,
and by her had four children--two daughters, Margaret and Anne, and two sons, John and David.
David is, as will be seen, not unrecorded in the annals of his country; but his name has been
completely eclipsed by that of his elder brother, the "bloody Claver'se" of the Whigs, the
"bonnie Dundee" of the Jacobites, one of the most execrated or one of the most idolised characters
in the history of this kingdom, according to the temper and the taste of the writers and readers
of history.

The register of that year shows that the two brothers matriculated at Saint Leonard's College
in the University of Saint Andrews, on February 13th, 1665. Before this date all is a blank.
Of John's boyish years history and tradition are equally silent. Long after his death, indeed,
some idle stories became current, as their fashion is, of prophecies and prodigies in that
early time. His nurse is said to have foretold that a river taking its name from a goose would
prove fatal to him, and to have lamented that her child's career of glory had been frustrated
because he had been checked in the act of devouring a live toad. This last story sounds much
like a popular version of the Grecian fable of Demophoön, as told in the Homeric hymn to Demeter.
But, as a matter of fact, it was a legend current of the infancy both of the Regent Morton
and of Montrose himself before it was given to Claverhouse; and possibly of many other youthful
members of the Scottish aristocracy, who happened to make themselves obnoxious to a class of
their countrymen whose piety seems to have added no holy point to their powers of invective.
There is an ingenious fancy, and, at least, as much reason as is generally displayed in mythological
researches, in the surmise that this particular legend may have owed its origin to the French
connection with Scotland, a connection which would naturally have found little favour in the
eyes of the followers of John Knox.

Claverhouse seems to have neglected neither the studies nor the discipline of the University.
He has, indeed, in our own time been denied enough even of the common intellectual culture
of his day to save him from ridicule as a blockhead. But there is no reason for this contemptuous
statement. His own contemporaries, and others, who if not exactly contemporaries have at least
as good right to be heard as a writer of our own time, have left very different testimony.
Burnet, who, though connected by marriage with Claverhouse and at one time much in his confidence,
was the last of men to praise him unduly, has vouched both for his abilities and virtues. Dalrymple,
who was certainly no Jacobite, though censured by the Whigs for his indulgence to James, has
described him as from his earliest youth an earnest reader of the great actions recorded by
the poets and historians of antiquity. More particular testimony still is offered by a writer
whose work was not, indeed, undertaken till nearly fifty years after the battle of Killiecrankie,
but whose pictures of those men and times have all the freshness and colour of a contemporary.
The author of those memoirs of Lochiel of which Macaulay has made such brilliant use, has credited
Claverhouse with a considerable knowledge of mathematics and general literature, especially
such branches of those studies as were likely to be of most use to a soldier. Lastly, Doctor
Munro, Principal of the College of Edinburgh, when charged before a Parliamentary Commission
with rejoicing at the news of Killiecrankie, denied at least that he had rejoiced at the death
of the conqueror, for whom he owned "an extraordinary value," such as, in his own words, "no
gentleman, soldier, scholar, or civilised citizen will find fault with me for."[2]

It would be as foolish to take these witnesses too literally, as it is foolish to call Claverhouse
a blockhead because he could not spell correctly. For many years after his death men of position
and abilities far more distinguished and acknowledged than his, were not ashamed to spell with
a recklessness that would inevitably now entail on any fourth-form boy the last penalty of
academic law. Scott says that Claverhouse spelled like a chambermaid; and Macaulay has compared
the handwriting of the period to the handwriting of washerwomen. The relative force of these
comparisons others may determine, but it is certain that in this respect at least Claverhouse
sinned in good company. The letters of even such men as the Lord Advocate, Sir George Mackenzie,
and the Dalrymples,--letters written in circumstances more favourable to composition than the
despatches of a soldier are ever likely to be--are every whit as capricious and startling in
their variations from the received standard of orthography. If it is impossible quite to agree
with his staunch eulogist, Drummond of Bahaldy, that Claverhouse was "much master in the epistolary
way of writing," at least his letters are plain and to the purpose; and the letters of a soldier
have need to be no more.

It is, of course, unlikely that he could have been, even for those days, a cultivated man.
The studies of youth are but the preparation for the culture of manhood; and after his three
quiet years at Saint Andrews were done, his leisure for study must have been scant indeed.
But all we know of his character, temperament, and habits of life forbid the supposition that
he wasted that precious time either in idleness or indulgence. His bitterest enemies have borne
witness to his singular freedom from those vices which his age regarded more as the characteristics
than the failings of a gentleman. The most scurrilous of the many scurrilous chroniclers of
the Covenanters' wrongs has owned in a characteristic passage that his life was uniformly clean.[3]
Gifted by nature with quick parts, of dauntless ambition and untiring energy both of mind and
body, he was not the man to have let slip in idleness any chance of fortifying himself for
the great struggle of life, or to have neglected studies which might be useful to him in the
future because they happened to be irksome in the present. It is only, therefore, in reason
to suppose that he managed his time at the University prudently and well, and this may easily
be done without assuming for him any special intellectual gifts or graces.

But, as a matter of strict fact, from the date of his matriculation to the year 1672 nothing
is really known of Claverhouse or his affairs. It has, however, been generally assumed that,
after the usual residence of three years at the University, he crossed over into France to
study the art of war under the famous Turenne. As the practice was common then among young
men of good birth and slender fortune, it is not unlikely that Claverhouse followed it. A large
body of English troops was a few years later serving under the French standard. In 1672 the
Duke of Monmouth, then in the prime of his fortune, joined Turenne with a force of six thousand
English and Scottish troops, amongst whom marched John Churchill, a captain of the Grenadier
company of Monmouth's own regiment. But the military glory Claverhouse is said to have won
in the French service cannot have been great: his studies in the art of war must have been
mainly theoretical. In the year 1668, the year in which Claverhouse is said to have left Scotland
for France, Lewis had been compelled to pause in his career of conquest. The Triple Alliance
had in that year forced upon him the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. He had been compelled to restore
Franche Comté, though he still kept hold of the towns he had won in the Low Countries. But
the joy with which all parties in England welcomed this alliance had scarcely found expression
when Charles, impatient of the economy of his Parliament and indifferent to its approval, opened
those negotiations which, with the help of his sister the Duchess of Orleans, and that other
Duchess, Louisa of Portsmouth, resulted in the secret treaty of Dover. We are not now concerned
to examine the particulars of a transaction which even Charles himself did not dare to confide
entirely to his ministers, familiar as the Cabal was with shameless deeds. It is enough for
our present purpose to remember that, in return for a large annual subsidy and the promise
of help should England again take up arms against her king, Charles bound himself to aid Lewis
in crushing the rising power of Holland and to support the claims of the House of Bourbon to
the throne of Spain. Supplies were obtained for immediate purposes by closing the Exchequer,
an act which ruined half the goldsmiths in London. As a set-off against this, a royal proclamation,
arrogating to itself powers only Parliament could rightly exercise, suspended the laws against
Nonconformists and Catholics. The latter were, indeed, allowed to say Mass only within their
private houses, but to dissenters of every other class was granted the freest liberty of public
worship.

The declaration of war followed close on the declaration of indulgence. The immediate result
of the latter was the release of John Bunyan from an imprisonment of twelve years, and the
publication of the "Pilgrim's Progress." A more important and lasting result was the Revolution
of 1688. Both declarations were unpopular, but the Declaration of Indulgence was the most unpopular
of the two. It was unpopular with the zealous Churchman for the concessions it made both to
Papist and Puritan. It was unpopular with the Puritan because he was compelled to share it
with the Papist. It was unpopular with the Papist because it was less liberal to him than to
the Puritan. It was unpopular with all classes of patriotic Englishmen alike, because it directly
violated that prerogative of the Legislature for which so much English blood had been already
shed. It was soon, indeed, repealed, and its repeal was soon followed by the dissolution of
the Cabal, the passing of the Test Act, and peace with Holland. But though the fears of the
nation were thus laid to rest for a time, it now first became clear to those who could look
beyond the passing day, and whose vision was sharpened by the memory of what had been, how
surely England was moving under the son back again to a state of things which had cost the
father his crown and his life.

But to return to the declaration of war. Lewis received, and probably expected to receive,
but little support from his English allies, and in a furious action fought off the coast of
Suffolk De Ruyter more than held his own against the combined fleets of France and England.
But on land the French King carried all before him. Led by Condé and Turenne, the ablest captains
of the age, a vast host poured across the Rhine. The Dutch were waked from the vain dreams
of a French alliance, into which they had been lulled by the chiefs of the great merchant class
which had risen to power on the fall of the House of Orange, only to find themselves helpless.
Town after town opened its gates to the invader: three out of the seven provinces of the Federation
were already in his hands: his watch-fires were seen from the walls of Amsterdam. In the first
mad paroxysm of their despair the people rose against their leaders. De Ruyter, who had borne
their flag to victory on many a hard fought day, was insulted in the public streets: the Grand
Pensionary, John De Witt, and his brother Cornelius were brutally murdered before the palace
of the States-General at the Hague. The office of Stadtholder was re-established; and the common
voice called back to it a prince of that House which twenty years ago had been excluded for
ever from the affairs of a State which had never existed without it.

William Henry, great-grandson of the founder of the Dutch Republic, hereafter to be known as
William the Third of England, was then in his twenty-second year. The heroic spirit of William
the Silent lived again in the frail body of his descendant. Without a moment's hesitation he
accepted the hard and thankless task imposed upon him. With wise counsel and brave words he
calmed and revived the drooping hearts of his countrymen. He rejected with scorn the offers
both of Charles and Lewis to seduce him from his allegiance. He replied to Buckingham's remonstrances
on the folly of a struggle which could only mean ruin to the Commonwealth, that he would fight
while there was a ditch left for him to die in. His courage spread. The Dutch flew to arms:
without a regretful voice they summoned to their aid their last irresistible ally: the dykes
were cut, and soon the waters, destroying to save, spread over all that trim and fertile land.
The tide of invasion was checked, and with the next spring it began to roll slowly backward.
The great princes of the Continent became alarmed at this new prospect of French ambition.
The sluggish Emperor began to bestir himself. Spain, fast dwindling to the shadow of that mighty
figure which had once bestrode two worlds, sent some troops to aid a cause which was, indeed,
half her own. By sea the Dutch could do no more than keep their flag flying, but it says much
for their sailors that they could do that against a foe their equal in skill and courage, and
almost always their superior in numbers. On land they were more successful. The Bishop of Munster
was driven back from the walls of Groningen: Naerden and Bonne were retaken: before the summer
was over the whole electorate of Cologne was in the hands of William and his allies. The campaign
of 1674 was less fortunate to the young general. Charles had, it is true, been compelled by
his Parliament to make a peace more favourable than the Dutch could have hoped for; but in
almost every direction Lewis made good again the ground he had lost in the previous year. William,
indeed, took Grave, but he was compelled to raise the siege of Oudenarde. A large force of
Germans under the Elector of Brandenburg was driven out of Alsace across the Rhine by Turenne,
who had a short while before completely routed the Imperial troops under the Duke of Lorraine
at Sintzheim. Franche Comté was reconquered in a few weeks. But the most notable action of
the year was the battle of Seneff, fought near Mons on August 11th between William and Condé.
It was long, bloody, and indecisive; but it raised William's reputation for courage and ability
to the highest pitch, and drew from his veteran opponent one of those compliments a brave soldier
is always glad to pay a foeman worthy of his steel. "The Prince of Orange," said Condé, "has
acted in everything like an old captain, except in venturing his life too like a young soldier."

The battle of Seneff has for us, too, a particular importance. It gives us, according to some
of his biographers, the first glimpse of Claverhouse as a soldier. The story goes that, at
an early period of the fight, William with a handful of his men was closely beset by a large
body of French troops. In making his way back to his own lines the Prince's horse foundered
in some marshy ground, and he would inevitably have been either killed or made prisoner had
not Claverhouse, who was of the party, mounted him on his own charger and brought him safe
out of the press. For this service William gave the young soldier (who was, however, the Prince's
senior by seven years) a captain's commission in his own regiment of Horse Guards, commanded
by the Count de Solmes who led the English van on the day of the Boyne. This story has been
contemptuously rejected by Macaulay as a Jacobite fable composed many years after both actors
in the scene were dead. The story may not be true, but Macaulay's reasons for rejecting it
are not quite exact. Reports of Claverhouse's gallantry at Seneff were certainly current during
his lifetime. It is mentioned, for example, in a copy of doggerel verses addressed to Claverhouse
by some nameless admirer on New Year's Day 1683.[4] And there is yet more particular testimony,
though, like the former, it is of that nature which a historian will always feel himself at
liberty to reject if it does not match with the rest of his case, and which counsel on the
opposite side are accordingly at equal liberty to make use of. In the memoirs of Lochiel mention
is made of a Latin poem written by a certain Mr. James Philip of Amryclos, in Forfarshire,
who bore Dundee's standard at Killiecrankie. Lochiel's biographer does not quote the Latin
text, but gives translations of certain passages. The original manuscript, bearing the date
1691, is now in the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh. Napier had seen this "Grameis," as the
work is called, and compared it with the translations, which he declares to be very imperfect,
as, from the specimens he gives, they undoubtedly are. Macaulay, who never saw the Latin text,
owns to have taken a few touches from the passages quoted in the memoirs for his inimitable
picture of affairs in the Highlands during the days immediately preceding Killiecrankie; but
the passage recording the early gallantry of the conqueror at Killiecrankie he did not take.[5]

It is unfortunate that the tale of these early years should assume so controversial a tone.
But where all, or almost all, is sheer conjecture, it is inevitable that the narrative must
rest rather on argument than fact. The precise moment when Claverhouse transferred his services
from the French to the Dutch flag is, in truth, no more certain than the date of his birth
is certain, or his conduct at Saint Andrews, or, indeed, than it is certain that he ever at
any time served under Lewis. The tale of those English services under the French King is in
the last degree confused and doubtful. If it is so in the case of such a man as Marlborough,
small wonder that it is so in the case of such a man as Claverhouse, whose name was practically
unknown till ten years before his death. That he did, however, at one time bear arms in the
Dutch ranks seems as indisputable as any part of the scanty story of the first two-and-thirty
years of his life can be said to be. But beyond this it is impossible to go.

In 1677 he left William's service and returned to Scotland. An idle story was circulated some
years afterwards of a brawl with one of William's officers who had received the regiment promised
to Claverhouse, of a reprimand from William, and an indignant vow never to serve again under
a prince who had broken his word. The judicial weight that has been brought to demolish this
slender fabric is unnecessary. The story itself is not consistent with the characters of either
men. It is very possible that the young soldier, like another young man of those days, may
have grown "tired with knocking at preferment's door;" but, in truth, a reason to account for
their parting is very easily found. With the campaign of 1677 all fighting on the Continent
was stayed for a time. Claverhouse's profession was fighting. After the peace of Nimeguen in
1678 Scotland was the only European country then offering a chance of employment to a soldier
of fortune. In 1677, accordingly, he resigned his commission in the Dutch service and crossed
over into England, taking with him a reputation for courage and ability that at once recommended
him to the King and Duke of York for a man likely to be useful in such affairs as they had
then on hand. Indeed, the character that it is clear he brought back with him from Holland
is alone sufficient to disprove the story of the quarrel in the courtyard at Loo.[6]

FOOTNOTES:

[1] Fountainhall's "Historical Notices:" Napier's "Memorials of Dundee," i. 183. The decision
in question is dated July 24th, 1687, and certainly appears to prove that Claverhouse did not
attain his majority till 1664, which would fix his birth in the year above given.

[2] The "Memoirs of the Life of Sir Ewan Cameron of Lochiel" were printed for the Abbotsford
Club in 1842. They are believed to have been written between 1730 and 1740 by John Drummond
of Bahaldy, a grandson, or great-grandson, of Lochiel. Several copies of the manuscript are
in existence, of which the best is said by the editor to be the one then in the possession
of Mr. Crawfurd of Cartsburn. It is written in a clear hand upon small quarto paper, and bound
in two volumes. On the fly-leaf of the first volume is written "Aug. 7. 1732, Jo. Drummond."
See also Burnet's "History of My Own Time," ii. 553; Dalrymple's "Memoirs of Great Britain
and Ireland," i. 344; Burton's "History of Scotland," vii. 360; Napier's "Memorials of Viscount
Dundee," i. 16-32, and 178-9. Burnet married Lady Margaret Kennedy, daughter of the Earl of
Cassilis and aunt of Lady Dundee. In point of style and arrangement, of taste and temper--in
everything, in short, which helps to make literature, Napier's book is perhaps as bad as it
is possible for a book to be. But his industry is unimpeachable; and, through the kindness
of the late Duke of Buccleuch, he was able to publish no less than thirty-seven letters written
in Claverhouse's own hand to the first Duke of Queensberry, not one of which had been included
in the collection printed for the Bannatyne Club in 1826, nor was, in fact, known to be in
existence by anyone outside the family of Buccleuch. His book includes also the fragment of
a memoir of Dundee and his times, left in manuscript by Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, of Hoddam,
Walter Scott's friend. The memoir was thrown up, it is said, in despair on the appearance of
"Old Mortality." Some idea of the extent to which Napier suffered from the _Lues Boswelliana_
may be gathered from the fact that he regards even the Claverhouse of that incomparable romance
as a libel.

    "I saw the man who at St. Neff did see
    His conduct, prowess, martial gallantry:
    He wore a white plumach that day; not one
    Of Belgians wore a white, but him alone
    And though that day was fatal, yet he fought,
    And for his part fair triumphs with him brought."

Laing's "Fugitive Scottish Poetry of the Seventeenth Century."

[5] The passage occurs in the fifth book. Dundee, retreating before the forces of the Convention,
is represented as musing over his camp-fire on the ingratitude of the Prince whose life he
had once saved.

    "Tu vero, Arctoæ gentis prædo improbe, tanti
    Fons et origo mali, Nassovi, ingrate virorum,
    Immeritum quid me, nunc Cæsaris arma secutum,
    Prosequeris toties, et iniquo Marte fatiges?
    Nonne ego, cum lasso per Belgia stagna caballo
    Agmina liligeri fugeres victricia Galli,
    Ipse mei impositum dorso salientis equi te
    Hostibus eripui, salvumque in castra reduxi?
    Hæcne mihi meriti persolvis præmia tanti?
    Proh scelus! O Soceri rapti nequissime sceptri!"

The translation, which is certainly, as Napier calls it, both imperfect and free, is to this
effect:

    "When the fierce Gaul through Belgian stanks you fled,
    Fainting, alone, and destitute of aid,
    While the proud victor urged your doubtful fate,
    And your tired courser sunk beneath your weight;
    Did I not mount you on my vigorous steed,
    And save your person by his fatal speed?
    For life and freedom then by me restored
    I'm thus rewarded by my Belgick Lord.
    Ungrateful Prince!"

[6] The stories of Claverhouse's conduct at Seneff, and of the quarrel at Loo, are told in
the "Life of Lieut.-General Hugh Mackay," by John Mackay of Rockfields, and in the "Memoirs
of the Lord Viscount Dundee," published in 1714, and professing to be written by an officer
of the army. This little book is remarkable chiefly as being the first recorded attempt at
a biography of Dundee. The writer was possibly not an officer, nor personally acquainted with
Dundee. But he had certainly contrived to learn a good deal about him and his affairs; and
as later research has either corroborated or, at least, made probable, much of his information,
it seems to me quite as fair to use it for Dundee, as to use the unsupported testimony of the
Covenanters against him. According to his biographer, Mackay himself was Claverhouse's successful
rival. According to the earlier writer, the man was David Colyear, afterwards Lord Portmore,
and husband of Catherine Sedley, Lady Dorchester, James's favourite and ugliest mistress.

CHAPTER II.

It will be necessary now to review the condition of Scotland at the time when Claverhouse began
first to be concerned in her affairs, and of the causes political and religious--if, indeed,
in Scottish history it be ever possible to separate the two--which produced that condition.
Without clearly understanding the state of parties which then distracted that unhappy country,
it will not be possible clearly to understand the position of Claverhouse; and without a clear
understanding of his position, it will certainly not be possible to form a just estimate of
his character. It is by too readily yielding to the charm of a writer, who had not then for
his purpose the impartial estimate of a human character so much as the embellishment of a political
principle, that public opinion has been for many years content to accept a savage caricature
in place of a portrait. It would be impertinent to say that Macaulay did not understand the
circumstances into which Claverhouse was forced, and the train of events which had caused them;
but it would not have suited his purpose so clearly and strictly to have explained them that
others might have traversed the verdict he intended to be established. He heard, indeed, and
he determined to hear, only one side of the case: indeed, at the time he wrote, there was not
much to be heard on the other; and on the evidence he accepted the verdict was a foregone conclusion.
It is impossible altogether to acquit Claverhouse of the charges laid to his account, nor will
any attempt here be made to do so; but even the worst that can be proved against him, when
considered impartially with the circumstances of his position and the spirit of the time, will,
I think, be found to take a very different complexion from that which has been somewhat too
confidently given to them.[7]

When Charles the Second was restored to the throne of his fathers he was hailed in Scotland
with the same tumultuous joy that greeted him in England. The Scottish nation was indeed weary
of the past. It was weary alike of the yoke of Cromwell and of the yoke of the Covenant. The
first Covenant--the Covenant of 1557--had been a protest against the tyranny of the Pope: the
Covenant of 1643 was a protest against the tyranny of the Crown. It was the Scottish supplement,
framed in the religious spirit and temperament of the Scottish nation, to the English protest
against ship-money. The voice, first sounded among the rich valleys and pleasant woods of Buckinghamshire,
was echoed in the churchyard of the Grey Friars at Edinburgh. Six months later the triumph
of Presbyterianism was completed, when in the church of Saint Margaret's at Westminster the
Commons of England ratified the Solemn League and Covenant of Scotland. Over the wild time
which followed it will be unnecessary for our purpose to linger. The work was done: then followed
the reaction. In both countries the oppressed became in turn the oppressors. The champions
of religious liberty became as bigoted and intolerant as those whose intolerance and bigotry
had first goaded them into rebellion. The old Presbyterian saw the rise of new modes of worship
with the same horror that he had shown at the ritual of Laud. Milton protested that the "new
Presbyter is but old Priest writ large." Within only four years of the outbreak of the civil
war no less than sixteen religious sects were found existing in open defiance of the principles
of faith which that war was pledged to uphold. One common bond, indeed, united these sects
in sympathy: one and all repudiated with equal energy the authority of the Church to prescribe
a fixed form of worship: a national Church was, in their eyes, as odious and impossible a tyranny
as the divine right of kings. But this common hatred of the interference of a Mother Church
could not teach them tolerance for each other. Cardinal Newman has described the enthusiasm
of Saint Anthony as calm, manly, and magnanimous, full of affectionate loyalty to the Church
and the Truth. "It was not," he says, "vulgar, bustling, imbecile, unstable, undutiful." The
religious enthusiasm of the two nations at this time, though at heart sincere and just, was
unfortunately in its public aspect the exact opposite of Saint Anthony's. There was the essential
great meaning of the matter, to borrow Carlyle's words, but there were also the mean, peddling
details. It was the misfortune of many, of three kings of England among the number, that the
latter should seem the most vital of the two. Presbyterian and Independent, Leveller and Baptist,
Brownist and Fifth Monarchy Man, one and all stood up and made proclamation, crying, "Look
unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else."
Well might Cromwell adjure them in that war of words which followed the sterner conflict on
the heights of Dunbar, "I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be
mistaken."

Though the number and variety of the dissentients in England were far greater than in Scotland,
where the bulk both of the people and the clergy stood firmly within the old Presbyterian lines,
yet in the latter country the separation was far more bitter and productive of far more violent
results. In the former the strong hand of Cromwell, himself an Independent, but keen to detect
a useful man under every masquerade of worship, and prompt to use him, kept the sects from
open disruption. Quarrel as they might among themselves, there was one stronger than them all,
and they knew it. The old Committee of Estates, originally appointed by the Parliament as a
permanent body in 1640, was not strong enough to control the spirit it had helped to raise:
it was not even strong enough to keep order within its own house. The new Committee was but
a tool in the hands of Argyle. The old Presbyterian viewed with equal dislike the sectaries
of Cromwell, the men of the Engagement which had cost Hamilton his head, and the Malignants
who had gathered to the standard of Montrose. The Resolutioner, who wished to repeal the Act
of Classes, was too lukewarm: the Remonstrant was too violent. It was by this last body that
the troubles we have now to examine came upon Scotland.

After the collapse of Hamilton's army at Uttoxeter in August 1648, a body of Covenanters assembled
at Mauchline, in Ayrshire, to protest against the leniency with which the Engagement had been
treated in the Estates, where, indeed, a considerable minority had been inclined openly to
countenance it. Their leader was at first the Earl of Eglinton, a staunch Covenanting lord;
but as they gathered strength Argyle joined them with his Highlanders, and the command soon
passed into his hands. The Protesters marched upon Edinburgh. In an attempt to take Stirling
Castle they were defeated by Sir George Monro with a division of Hamilton's army which had
not crossed the border; but Argyle had better tools to work with than the claymores of his
Highlanders. He opened negotiations with Cromwell, who led an army in person into Scotland,
renewed the Covenant, laid before the Estates (the new Estates of Argyle and his party) certain
considerations, as he diplomatically called them, demanding, among other things, that no person
accessory to the Engagement should be hereafter employed in any public place or trust. The
Committee were only too willing to have the support of Cromwell to what they themselves so
vehemently desired. Two Acts were quickly passed: one reversing many of the acts of its predecessors
and confirming the considerations: the other, known in history as the Act of Classes, defining
the various misdemeanours which were to exclude men from sitting in Parliament or holding any
public office, for a period measured by their offences, and practically to be determined by
the judicatories of the Kirk.

This Mauchline Convention was popularly known at the time as the Whiggamores' Raid, a name
memorable as the first introduction into history of a word soon to become only too familiar,
and still a part of our political vocabulary.[8] Its immediate result was to throw the direction
of affairs still more exclusively into the hands of the clergy: indirectly, but no less surely,
it was the cause of the Pentland Rising and the savage persecution which followed, of the murder
of Archbishop Sharp, of the battles of Drumclog and Bothwell Bridge, and of those terrible
years still spoken of in Scotland as the "killing-time." It was, in short, like the wrath of
Achilles, the spring of unnumbered woes.

Then followed the execution of Charles. Against this the whole body of Presbyterians joined
in protesting. The hereditary right of kings was, indeed, as much a principle of the Covenant
as their divine right was opposed to it; and the execution at Whitehall on January 30th, 1649,
was regarded with as much horror by the Presbyterians of England as by the Presbyterians of
Scotland.

The first act of the Estates was to proclaim the Prince of Wales king of Great Britain, their
next to send a deputation to Holland to invite him to take possession of his kingdom. It had
been better both for Charles and for Scotland that the invitation had never been accepted.
The terms on which alone the Scots would see the son of Charles Stuart back among them as crowned
king were such as only the direst necessity could have induced him to accept: they were such
as it seems now amazing that even the most bigoted and inexperienced could really have believed
that the son of his father, or, indeed, any man in his position, would keep one moment longer
than circumstances compelled him. But his advisers, led on by Wilmot and Buckingham, bid him
sign--sign everything, or all would be lost. He signed everything. First he put his hand to
the Solemn League and Covenant: then to a second declaration promising to do his utmost to
extirpate both Popery and Prelacy from all parts of his kingdom: finally, he consented to figure
as the hero of a day of public fasting and humiliation for the tyranny of his father and the
idolatry of his mother. And while he was acquiescing to each fresh demand with a shrug of his
shoulders and a whispered jest to Buckingham, and in his heart as much hatred for his humiliators
as he was capable of feeling for anybody, he was all the while urging on Montrose to strike
that wild blow for his crown which was to lead the brave marquis to the scaffold. The deaths
of Hamilton and Huntly had preceded the death of Montrose by a few weeks: a few more weeks
and Charles was in Scotland, a crowned king in name, virtually a prisoner. Within little more
than a year the fight at Dunbar, and the "crowning mercy" of Worcester, had bitterly taught
him how futile was all the humiliation he had undergone.

It will be enough to briefly recall the main incidents of the years which intervened between
the battle of Worcester and the Restoration. After the establishment of the Protectorate an
Act of Indemnity was passed for the Scottish people. From this certain classes were excepted.
All of the House of Hamilton, for instance, and some other persons of note, including Lauderdale:
all who had joined the Engagement, or who had not joined in the protestation against it: all
who had sat in Parliament or on the Committee of Estates after the coronation of Charles at
Scone: all who had borne arms at the battle of Worcester. From this proscribed list, however,
Argyle managed to extricate himself. He had fortified himself at Inverary, and summoned a meeting
of the Estates to which the chiefs of the Royalist party had been bidden. To conquer him in
his own stronghold would have been difficult, perhaps impossible, to English soldiers unused
to such warfare. Cromwell wisely preferred to negotiate, and Argyle was not hard to bring to
terms. He bound himself to live at peace with the Government, and to use his best endeavours
to persuade others to do so. In return he was to be left unmolested in the free enjoyment of
his estates, and in the exercise of religion according to his conscience.

The politicians were now silenced; but a noisier and more troublesome body had still to be
reckoned with. In July, 1653, the General Assembly was closed, and Resolutioners and Remonstrants
were sent to the right about together. Some measures, however, had to be taken to prevent them,
not from cutting each other's throats, which would have suited the Government well enough,
but from stirring up a religious war, which they would inevitably have done if left to the
free enjoyment of their own humours. It was necessary so to strengthen the hands of one of
the two parties that the other should be compelled to refrain at least from open hostilities.
The Resolutioners, as the most tolerant and the mildest-mannered, would have been those Cromwell
would have preferred to see in the ascendency. But the Resolutioners had acknowledged Charles,
and were, after their own fashion, in favour of the royal title. The Remonstrants were accordingly
preferred. They, indeed, denied the authority of the Commonwealth over spiritual matters, but
they also denied the authority of Charles; and it was felt that at such a crisis the civil
allegiance was of more value than the religious. A law was accordingly established dividing
Scotland into five districts, in each of which certain members of the Remonstrant clergy were
empowered to ordain ministers, as it were, to the exercise of their functions. At the same
time it was not the object of Cromwell to exalt one party at the expense of the other so much
as to strike a balance between the two; and in doing this he was much served by the tact and
good sense of James Sharp, whose name now first begins to be heard in Scottish history. He
was on the side of the Resolutioners, but he so managed matters as to be favourably regarded
by the Government as a person likely to be of service to them in the event of any open disruption
between the two bodies, without losing the confidence of his own party. The Court of Session
was the next to go, and in its place rose the Commission of Justice, of which James Dalrymple,
afterwards Lord Stair, the first Scottish lawyer of his day, was the most conspicuous member.
In 1654 the Act for incorporating the Union between England and Scotland was passed by the
Commonwealth. With that Commonwealth disappeared the Union, but the few years of its existence
were fruitful of at least one great boon to Scotland. In those years was established free-trade
between the two countries: a boon for Scotland which she never properly appreciated till she
lost it by the Navigation Act of the Restoration: an alleged grievance to England which had
its share in bringing that Restoration to pass; for it was then, and for long after, a fixed
principle in the philosophy of English commerce that free-trade between the two countries meant
pillaging Englishmen to enrich Scotchmen. A regular postal service was also established. The
abortive rising known as Glencairn's Expedition was the only act of open hostility that broke
those few years of comparative tranquillity; and the lenient terms granted by Monk to the Highland
leader tended more than anything to show how weary of the long rule of disorder and bloodshed
all the best of the two nations were growing. On September 3rd, 1658, Oliver Cromwell died,
and in November of the following year Monk began his famous march to London. On May 25th, 1660,
Charles the Second landed at Dover.

Though the Remonstrants had won the upper hand for a time, the bulk of the Scottish nation
had been all along on the side of the Resolutioners. Much as the character and religious views
of Charles were to their distaste, the principle of the Covenant was for a king, and it was
by the principle of the Covenant that the Scottish nation stood. The stern and narrow bigotry
of the Remonstrants, whom their short taste of power had made of course more fanatical and
more quarrelsome than ever, had almost succeeded in forcing the more moderate Presbyterians
into the arms of the Royalists. A little tolerance, a little tact on the English side would
probably have cemented the alliance. But it was not to be.

It is important to remember this. The extreme party with which Claverhouse had to deal no more
represented the Scottish nation than the Irishmen who follow Mr. Parnell's call in the House
of Commons represent their nation now, or than men like Napper Tandy and Wolfe Tone represented
it a century ago. It seems still a common belief that Claverhouse and his troopers were sent
to force upon a sober, patient, God-fearing nation a religion and a king that they abhorred.
Nothing could be farther from the truth. The large majority of the Scottish nation was as eager
to welcome Charles as the old squires who had lost their fortunes for his father, or the young
bloods who hoped to find fortunes under the son. The narrow and blatant form of religion professed
by the extreme party was as repulsive to the bulk of their countrymen as to the King himself.

These men were a remnant of the old Remonstrants of the Mauchline Convention. They had originally,
as we have seen, looked to Argyle as their leader; but when Argyle ranged himself on the side
of the young King there were some among them who would not follow him. These maintained, and
so far they were unquestionably right, that the "young man Charles Stuart" was, for all his
protestations and oaths, as much at heart a Malignant as his father; and that those who pretended
to believe him were playing the Kirk and the Covenant false. When Cromwell marched into Scotland
to win the battle of Dunbar these men had formed themselves into a separate party under Colonel
Archibald Strachan, an able soldier who commanded that division of Leslie's army which had
defeated Montrose in Rossshire. Strachan's design seems to have been to stand aloof for the
present from either side; but from some not very intelligible cause he fell into disgrace with
his party, and this is said to have so preyed upon his mind as to have caused his death. From
that time the Wild Westland Whigs, as they began now to be called, had no ostensible leader.
They withdrew sullenly to their own homes, contenting themselves during the remaining years
of the Commonwealth with protesting against everybody and everything outside their own narrow
circle. They must not be confounded with the general body of the Remonstrants, between whom
and the Resolutioners Cromwell had to keep the balance. They were a people apart. Throughout
the wild hill-districts of the Western Lowlands they preached their fierce crusade against
all who were not prepared to stand by the spirit of the Covenant as they chose to interpret
it. The toleration they demanded they would not give. No man should be free to worship God
as he pleased: every man must worship Him in the way which seemed good to them, and in that
way only. The moderate Presbyterians were as hateful to them as Charles himself and all his
bishops; and they in their turn were as obnoxious to the majority of the Scottish nation as
to the English Government. Cleric and layman alike was weary of the unending squabbles that
had distracted the Church of Scotland since the days of Knox. They wished for peace; and no
peace was possible so long as an ignorant and noisy minority would suffer it only at their
own price.

One other point should also be remembered. It has been the custom to excuse the cruelties of
the Covenanters, when they could not be denied, as the acts of men goaded into madness by years
of persecution. This excuse will hardly serve. It might, indeed, serve to explain the murder
of Sharp and the savage deeds of such men as Hamilton and Burley; but long before that time
the Scottish fanatic had proved himself a match in ferocity for the bloodiest Malignant of
them all. After Philiphaugh one hundred Irish prisoners were shot in cold blood, while a minister
of the Covenanting Church stood by, reiterating in savage glee, "The wark goes bonnily on."
About the same time eighty women and children were in one day flung over the bridge at Linlithgow
for the crime of having been followers of the camp of Montrose. In 1647 three hundred of the
Macdonalds who held a fortified post on a hill in Kintire surrendered at discretion to David
Leslie. It is said that Leslie would have let them go but for his chaplain, John Nave. Borrowing
the words of Samuel, "What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing
of the oxen which I hear?" in a long and fiery harangue this man of God exhorted the conquerors
to finish their work, and threatened their captain with the curse of Saul who spared the Amalekites.
The prisoners were butchered to a man.[9]

If, then, it be but a delusion of later times that Scotland could at the Restoration have been
conciliated into accepting a moderate form of Episcopacy, it is at least clear that there was
at that time a strong party in the country anxious for a compromise between the two Churches,
and willing to make all reasonable advances towards one. Unfortunately the first move on both
sides was of a nature to make all chances of a compromise impossible.

Charles had conceived a violent dislike to Presbyterianism, and with his experiences of it
the dislike was not unnatural. It was not, he told Burnet, a religion for gentlemen, and he
found few among his court to contradict him. Scarcely had he settled himself in his capital
when the Presbyterians were upon him. Sharp had already been some months in London as ambassador
of the moderate party, the party of the old Resolutioners. But an easy way of reconciling Sharp's
conscience was soon found. It is not precisely clear when the bargain was struck which was
to convert the chosen champion of the Presbyterian Church into an archbishop, but struck it
was, and in no long time. He had by Monk's advice visited Charles at Breda, and some suppose
that the first interview completed the transformation. If so, he managed to delude his party
very skilfully. His letters to the Assembly, though the light of subsequent events enables
us to translate them more clearly than was possible at the time, were full of wise counsel,
of apparently honest confessions of the many difficulties he foresaw in the way, and of protestations
of fidelity and firmness which were no less implicitly believed. "I told him," said his colleague
Robert Douglas, a man of very different stamp, when Sharp went up to London later for his ordination,
"I told him the curse of God would be on him for his treacherous dealing; and that I may speak
my heart of this man, I profess I did no more suspect him in reference to Prelacy than I did
myself."[10]

Meanwhile the extreme party had not been idle. It will be perhaps most convenient henceforth
to distinguish them as Covenanters: to call them Whigs, as Burnet and other historians of the
time call them, would not convey to modern ears the significance it had for their contemporaries.
Even those stern and unbending Tories of whom Mr. Gladstone was once the spokesman have long
ceased to regard the men who are still sometimes called Whigs as the most fanatical members
of the body politic. It would be no mere fanciful application of modern terms to distinguish
the two parties of the Scottish Church as Liberals and Radicals; but it will for many reasons
be best henceforth to write of them as Presbyterians and Covenanters.

The Covenanters, then, had not been idle. Shortly after the Restoration they had, through a
deputation of their elders and ministers, called upon their brethren of the Church to unite
with them in an address to the King, praying him, as a member of the Covenant with themselves,
to remember his obligations to that sacred institution and zealously to prosecute its blessed
work in all his three kingdoms. Toleration in things religious was especially denounced as
a vast mischief disguised under the specious pretence of liberty for tender consciences. Schismatics
were to be stamped out as sternly as Papists and Prelatists; and by Schismatics were meant
all men, members of their own Church no less than of others, who ventured to differ from them
on any point of doctrine whatsoever.

The Committee of Estates, which had resumed its sittings, did not like the job. They called
the deputation a private meeting of some protesting ministers, and clapped the leaders into prison.

A government had now been formed for Scotland. Middleton was Lord High Commissioner, a soldier
of fortune who had been raised to the peerage for the occasion. He was also named commander-in-chief
of the forces and governor of Edinburgh Castle. With him were associated Glencairn as Lord
Chancellor, Lauderdale as Secretary of State, Rothes as President of the Council, and Crawford
as Lord Treasurer. The first proceeding of this Parliament, known in the gossip of the time
as the Drunken Parliament from the too frequent condition of its chiefs, was to pass a Rescissory
Act, repealing all measures that had become law since the year 1633, including even those passed
by the Parliament professing the authority of Charles himself. This was followed by an Act
"concerning religion and Church government," in which, after some pious but vague protestations
of the royal design to "encourage the exercise of religion both public and private, and to
suppress all profaneness and disorderly walking," it was promised that the administration by
sessions, presbyteries, and synods would not for the present be interfered with. That present,
however, soon passed. On May 27th, two days before the anniversary of the Restoration of the
Monarchy, the Act for the Restoration of Episcopacy was made law. A previous Act had ordained
May 29th to be kept holy; and the opposition taken to this by those who objected to all holidays
as idolatrous had in turn produced a measure which practically marks the beginning of that
system of vague bullying, as Dr. Burton has happily called it, which was in no long time to
pass into a persecution anything but vague. On December 15th, in Westminster Abbey, Sharp was
consecrated Primate of Scotland, and at the same time Fairfoul was raised to the see of Glasgow,
Hamilton to the see of Galloway, and the good and gentle Leighton to the see of Dunblane.

Meanwhile the English Parliament had by its Navigation Act crushed for the time the short-lived
hopes of Scottish commerce, and was now busy with an Act of Indemnity. This had been practically
one of the conditions of the Restoration, but Scotland had not been included in the bargain.
Argyle was the first to suffer from the omission. He had gone up to London to pay his court
to the new King, but had been refused an audience. He was arrested, and, after a short sojourn
in the Tower, sent back to Edinburgh to stand his trial for high treason before the Estates.
He was found guilty and beheaded in the High Street on May 27th, 1661, two days after the anniversary
of the more shameful death which he had helped to bring upon Montrose. As he had been expressly
pardoned during the King's short reign in Scotland for all acts committed by him against the
Crown up to the year 1657, and as his accusers could find no evidence of communications with
the Parliament after that time, he must have been acquitted had it not been for Monk, who at
the last moment produced certain letters written by Argyle to him when acting for Cromwell.
Johnstone of Warriston was another victim, whom, like Argyle, it was no hard matter for judges
who had a mind that way to bring within the compass of the law of treason. He, however, managed
to get across to the Continent before he could be arrested. He was tried and condemned in his
absence. After two years of painful shifts and wanderings he was tracked down in France by
a man known as Crooked-back Murray, and sent back to his fate. A third victim was James Guthrie,
the most vehement and active of the Covenanters, the framer of the original Remonstrance and
author of a seditious pamphlet called "The Causes of the Lord's Wrath." With him would probably
have suffered Samuel Rutherford, a minister as zealous as Guthrie, but of more education and
manners. Fortunately for him, he died before the reign of punishment began; and the Government
was forced to content itself with ordering his book "Lex, Rex," to be burned by the hangman
at the Cross of Edinburgh and at the gate of the University of Saint Andrews, where he had
been Professor of Divinity. In 1662, an Act of Indemnity was made law, by which future punishment
for the past was adjusted by a scale of fines.

Close on the heels of the Act of Indemnity followed one demanding from all persons holding
any office of public trust a public abjuration of the Covenant, and another requiring all clergymen
who had been appointed since 1649 to receive collation from the bishop of their diocese. Those
who did not obey were, after a short respite, expelled from their parishes. Those who obeyed
were regarded by their congregations as backsliders and self-seekers. Three hundred and fifty
ministers were driven with their families from their homes in the depth of winter; and to supply
their places new ministers were appointed, popularly known as the King's Curates. Another Act
required attendance at the parish church on penalty of a fine graduated according to the rank
of the absentee. Finally, to crown all, the Solemn League and Covenant was publicly burned
at the market-cross of Edinburgh; and an aggravated copy of the English Five-mile Act against
Non-jurors, known as the Mile Act, was passed, prohibiting all recusant clergymen from residing
within twenty miles of their old parishes, within six miles of Edinburgh or any cathedral town,
and within three miles of any royal burgh. The punishment for transgressing this law was to
be the same as that for sedition.

Enough has now been said to show the nature of the bullying adopted by the Government. Over
the years which still lie between us and the entry of Claverhouse on the stage I must pass
more rapidly.

In 1663 Rothes succeeded Middleton as commissioner. The latter had been rash enough to measure
his strength with Lauderdale, and had been signally worsted. To complete the legislative machinery
a Conventicle Act was passed this year, declaring all assemblies of more than five persons,
besides members of the family, unlawful and seditious. As most of their congregations had followed
the expelled ministers into the wilderness, this new law so mightily increased the labours
of the authorities that it was found necessary to institute a new tribunal of justice for the
especial treatment of ecclesiastical offences. This was no less than a renewal of that old
Court of High Commission which had been abolished by the Long Parliament twenty years before
to the joy of the whole nation. To strengthen its hands a body of troops was sent down into
the western shires, now the stronghold of the Covenant, to impose and exact the fines ordained
by the Commission. Their leader was Sir James Turner, a man of some education, but rough and
brutal. He had served on the Continent under Gustavus Adolphus, had fought under Leslie in
the Presbyterian ranks, and had accompanied Hamilton with the Engagers into England. Turner,
in his own memoirs, declares that he not only did not exceed his orders, but was even lenient
beyond his commission. When, a few years later, in a momentary fit of indulgence, his acts
were called in question by the Privy Council, the evidence hardly served to establish his assertion.

At length the West rose. On November 13th, 1666, four countrymen came into the little village
of Dalry, in Galloway, in search of refreshment. There they found a few soldiers, driving before
them a body of peasants to thresh out the corn of an old man who would not pay his fines. There
was an argument and a scuffle: a pistol was fired and a soldier fell: the rest yielded. It
was now too late to go back. Turner was posted at Dumfries with a considerable sum of money
in his charge. It was determined to seize him. The four champions had now been joined by some
fifty horsemen and a large body of unmounted peasants. Turner was made prisoner; and the money
restored to the service of those from whose pockets it had been originally drawn.

The number of the insurgents had now risen to three thousand. They determined to march on Edinburgh,
thinking to gather recruits on the way; but when they came within five miles of the city their
hearts failed them. The weather was bitterly cold: provisions and arms were scarce: the peasantry
of the more cultivated districts had proved either lukewarm to the cause or openly hostile:
no recruits had come in, and their own ranks were growing daily thinner. At length they turned
on their tracks and made once more for their western fastnesses. But they had now to reckon
with a more dangerous foe than Turner.

The garrison in Edinburgh was commanded by Thomas Dalziel, a ferocious old soldier who had
learned his trade in the Russian wars. His dress was as uncouth as his manners, and he wore
a long white bushy beard that no steel had been suffered to touch since the death of the first
Charles.[11] With all the regulars he could muster Dalziel was quickly after the fugitives.
He came up with them on Rullion Green, a ridge of the Pentland Hills. Though now numbering
scarce a thousand men, the Covenanters were strongly posted, and defended themselves bravely.
The royal troops were twice driven back before they could carry the ridge, and night had fallen
before the insurgents were fairly broken. The slaughter was not great; and it is significant
of the unpopularity of their cause that the fugitives suffered more from the Lothian peasantry
than from the victorious soldiers.

The Government could now assume the virtue of those who are summoned to quell an open rebellion.
Dalziel was put in command of the insurgent districts, and his little finger was indeed found
thicker than Turner's loins. Twenty men were hanged on one gibbet in Edinburgh and many others
in various parts of the country: crowds were shipped off to the plantations: torture was freely
applied, and the ingenious devices of the boot and the thumbkin were in daily requisition.[12]
Dalziel was in his element. A prisoner reviled him at the council board for "a Muscovy beast
who roasted men." The old savage struck the man with the hilt of his sword so fiercely in the
mouth that the blood gushed out.

At length there came a lull. Weary of the useless butchery, which, hitherto, they had not perhaps
fully realised, the English Government determined to see if indulgence could persuade where
persecution was powerless to force. Orders to that effect were sent up to Edinburgh. The soldiers
were withdrawn from the western shires. Sharp was bidden to retire to his see. Lauderdale took
the place of Rothes as commissioner.

The character of Lauderdale is one of the most curious problems of the time. In his youth he
had been as zealous for the Covenant as he now appeared to be zealous for Episcopacy. Hence
some have supposed that his real design was by favouring the intolerance of the bishops to
bring them to discomfiture, and to re-establish on their ruin the old Presbyterian Church,
for which, despite the profligacy of his life and conversation, he was still believed to entertain
as much veneration as he was capable of feeling for any form of religion. But whatever may
have been his regard for the old Covenant of his youth, he was set as a rock against the men
who were now as much opposed to any moderate observance of Presbyterian worship as the most
inveterate Malignant at Whitehall.

The first Indulgence was passed in 1669, in favour of the ministers whom the Act of 1662 had
driven from their parishes. Such as had since that time kept from open violation of the law
were now to be reinstated in their livings where vacant. The manse and the glebe were to be
theirs as formerly, but the stipend was not to be renewed. These terms were accepted by some
forty or fifty clergymen. By the advice of the gentle Leighton, who almost alone among his
brethren seems at this time to have dared, or to have been even willing, to counsel tolerance,
a deputation, nicknamed "the Bishop's Evangelists," was sent into the West to preach the doctrine
of this Indulgence. The pious crusade was in vain. The failure of the Pentland rising and its
terrible sequel had turned those stubborn hearts to madness. Their weaker brethren were now
classed with the apostate Sharp and the butcher Dalziel; and the Indulgence was declared a
snare for the soul far more deadly than any torture the Government could devise for the body.
Nor, if time could have strengthened Leighton's hands, was time allowed him. Following close
upon the Indulgence came a fresh Act, now making not only all field-preaching a capital offence,
but even laying heavy penalties on any exercise of the Presbyterian worship except under an
Indulged minister. This again was soon followed by a fresh law against Intercommuning--that
is to say, against all who should offer even the simplest act of common charity to a Covenanter--and
promising large rewards to all who should give information against them or their protectors.
By this law it is said that thousands of both sexes, including many persons of rank, suffered
severely; and from it sprang a curious incident in the miserable history of this time.

An order was issued to the landed gentry of Renfrew and Ayr, the shires where the disaffection
was strongest, requiring them to give bail that their servants and tenants should not only
abstain from personal attendance at conventicles, but also from all intercourse with intercommuned
persons. The gentry answered that such assurance was impossible. It was not, they said, within
the compass of their power to do this thing. The reply from Edinburgh was short and conclusive:
if the landlords could not keep order in their districts, order must be kept for them. A body
of English troops had already been moved up to the border and an Irish force collected at Belfast;
but a more ingenious mode of punishment was now devised. Since the barbarous excesses of the
Highland clans under Montrose, it had become an acknowledged breach of the rules of civilised
warfare to employ men who, like the Red Indians used in our own American wars, were amenable
to no discipline and recognised no principles of humanity. Eight thousand of these savages
were now let loose on the disobedient Lowlanders. The result was, indeed, not all that had
been anticipated at Edinburgh. The Council had naturally enough expected that the descent of
these plaided barbarians would be the signal for a general insurrection, which would relieve
them of their troubles as certainly and much more conveniently than Dalziel's dragoons and
Perth's thumbkins. While Highlander and Lowlander were cutting each other's throats, Lauderdale
and his colleagues would have ample leisure to decide on the apportionment of the booty.[13]
In this, however, they were disappointed. No armed resistance was offered. During the two months
these marauders lived at free quarters, without any distinction between friend and foe, on
a land which, compared with their own barren moors and mountains, was a paradise flowing with
milk and honey, only one life was lost, and that the life of a Highlander. At length the scandal
became too great even for Lauderdale. Hamilton, who, like his brother before him, had always
stood by the Crown, went up to London with several gentlemen of rank to protest against a tyranny
which they vowed was that of Turks rather than Christians. According to one account, the King
would not see them: according to another, he admitted Hamilton to an interview, and, after
hearing his protest, owned that many bad things had been done in Scotland, but none, so far
as he could see, contrary to his interests. It was clear, however, that in this matter Lauderdale
had gone too far. The Highlanders were ordered to return to their homes. They returned accordingly,
laden with spoil such as they had never dreamed of, and of the use of a large part of which
they were as ignorant as a Red Indian or a negro.[14]

The departure of the Highland host leaves the stage free for Claverhouse. It was at this crisis
he returned to Scotland, and here this summary of one of the most miserable chapters in British
history may fitly end.

FOOTNOTES:

[7] This is, perhaps, the best place to disclaim all intention of scoffing at this great writer
and historian. It is a common impertinence of the day in which I have no wish to join. It is
not, I hope, an impertinence to say that only those who have, for their own purposes, been
forced to follow closely in his tracks can have any just idea of the unwearying patience and
acuteness with which he has examined the confused and so often conflicting records of that
time, or of the incomparable skill with which he has brought them into a clear continuous narrative.
To glean after Macaulay is indeed a barren task. So far, then, from affecting to cavil at his
work, I must acknowledge that without his help this little book would have been still less.
Yet I do think he has been hard upon Claverhouse. Perhaps the scheme of his history did not
require, or even allow him, to examine the man's character and circumstances so closely as
a biographer must examine them. It is still more important to remember that the letters discovered
by Napier in the Queensberry Archives were not known to him. Had he seen them, I am persuaded
that he would have found reason to think less harshly of their writer.

and the northern parts producing more than they need, those in the west come in the summer
to buy at Leith the stores that come from the north; and from a word 'whiggam,' used in driving
their horses, all that drove were called the 'whiggamores,' and shorter, the 'whiggs.' Now
in that year, after the news came down of Duke Hamilton's defeat, the ministers animated the
people to rise and march to Edinburgh; and they came up, marching on the head of their parishes,
with an unheard-of fury, praying and preaching all the way as they came. The Marquis of Argyle
and his party came and headed them, they being about 6,000. This was called the Whiggamores'
Inroad: and even after that all that opposed the Court came in contempt to be called Whiggs:
and from Scotland the word was brought into England, where it is now one of our unhappy terms
of distinction."--Burnet, i. 58. See also Scott's "Tales of a Grandfather," ch. xii. Mr. Green,
however, thought the word _whig_ might be the same as our _whey_, implying a taunt against
the "sour-milk faces" of the fanatical Ayrshiremen.--"History of the English People," iii. 258.

of linen and woollen cloth, some silver plate bearing the names and arms of gentlemen. You
would have seen them with loads of bedclothes, carpets, men and women's wearing clothes, pots,
pans, gridirons, shoes and other furniture whereof they had pillaged the country."--Wodrow,

CHAPTER III.

Claverhouse was not left long in idleness. In 1664, the year of the first Indulgence, it had
been determined to withdraw the regular troops altogether from Scotland, leaving their place
to be supplied by the local militia, which was now practically raised to the condition of a
standing army and, contrary to immemorial law, placed under the immediate authority of the
Crown. But the bishops and their clergy had demurred. They had little fancy for being left
with no other protection than a half-disciplined rabble, who, ready as they might be to act
against their troublesome countrymen, had no more respect for a lawn sleeve than for a homespun
jerkin. A few troops of regular cavalry were therefore retained, and one regiment of Foot Guards.
The former were commanded by Athole, the latter by Linlithgow. Towards the end of 1677 a fresh
troop of cavalry was raised, and the command given to the young Marquis of Montrose, grandson
to him who had died on the scaffold and kinsman to Claverhouse.

Claverhouse applied to him for employment, and it appears from Montrose's answer that the application
had been warmly backed by the Duke of York. "You cannot imagine," runs the letter, "how overjoyed
I should be to have any employment at my disposal that were worthy of your acceptance; nor
how much I am ashamed to offer you anything so far below your merit as that of being my lieutenant;
though I be fully persuaded that it will be a step to a much more considerable employment,
and will give you occasion to confirm the Duke in the just and good opinion which I do assure
you he has of you." The writer goes on to say that he himself was expecting instant promotion,
and to promise his kinsman a share in whatever fortune might befall him: none but gentlemen,
he adds, are to ride in his troop. The offer was accepted, and the promotion was not long delayed.

The Indulgence had failed, as by some at least of those who had countenanced it it had been
expected to fail. The Opposition, led at Edinburgh by Hamilton and Argyle, and backed in London
by Monmouth and Shaftesbury, which had for some time past been working openly against Lauderdale,
had also for the moment failed. The Commissioner's hands were strong. With the King and the
Duke of York at his back, and, in Edinburgh, Sharp, Burnet, and the majority of the Episcopalian
clergy, together with all the needy nobles who loved best to fish in troubled waters, Lauderdale
could afford, as he thought then, to laugh at all opposition. To assume that his design had
been from the first to goad the West into open rebellion affords, indeed, a simple explanation
of a policy that in its persistent unwisdom and brutality seems strangely irrational and monstrous,
even for such times and men. But it is rash to take any policy as certain in those dark and
crooked councils, unless it be--as probably in Lauderdale's case it was, and as it assuredly
was in the case of most of his creatures--the policy of personal aggrandisement. At any rate,
after the failure of the Indulgence had been made clear even to those hopeful spirits who still,
with Leighton, had believed it possible to efface years of wrong by a few grudging concessions,
the cruel game was renewed with fresh vigour. The Highlanders, indeed, had gone, but their
place was now to be filled by a more dangerous because a more disciplined foe. Orders were
given to raise three new troops of cavalry for special service in Scotland. The Earls of Home
and Airlie were chosen by Lauderdale to command two of these troops: the third was, at the
King's express desire, given to Claverhouse. At the same time, Athole, who was now in opposition
with Hamilton and Argyle, was superseded by Montrose, and Linlithgow named commander-in-chief
of all the royal forces in Scotland.

Claverhouse now for the first time steps in his own person on the stage of Scottish history.
Eleven years later, in 1689, he passes off it for ever. It is with the tale of that brief time,
so crowded with action, so variously recorded, that we shall be from this point concerned.

He was now in his thirty-fifth year. Confused and conflicting as the witnesses of his life
and character may be, of the man himself as he looked to the eyes of his contemporaries there
is the clearest testimony. Over the mantelpiece of Scott's study in Castle Street hung the
only picture in the room--a portrait of Claverhouse. An original portrait Lockhart calls it,
but which of the five portraits engraved in Napier's volumes it may have been, if any of them,
I cannot tell. All these engravings, with a unanimity not common in the portraiture of the
time, show the same face: a face of delicate, almost feminine beauty, framed in the long full
love-locks of the period.[15] The eyes are large and dark, the figure small but well made,
and the general expression of the countenance one of almost boyish smoothness and simplicity.
His manners were gentle and courteous, though reserved: his habit of life was, as has been
already said, singularly decorous: he was scrupulous in the observance of all religious ordinances.
After his death an old Presbyterian lady, who had lodged below him in Edinburgh, told Lochiel's
biographer how astonished she had been to find one of his profession so regular in his devotions.
In truth, one of the most curious, and at the same time one of the most indisputable, points
in the life of this singular man is the contrast between those public actions which have had
so large a share in moulding the popular impression, and his private character and conduct.
And not less curious is the contrast between the reality of his personal appearance and the
counterfeit presentment likely to be fostered by a too liberal adherence to that impression.
It would be difficult to imagine a more complete surprise than awaits those who turn for the
first time from the stern, brutal, and profane soldier of the historian's page to the high-bred
and graceful gentleman of the painter's canvas.

Claverhouse seems to have received his commission in the autumn of 1678. The earliest of his
letters extant is dated from Moffat, a small town in the north of Dumfriesshire, on December
28th. It is addressed to Lord Linlithgow, and contains this significant passage: "On Tuesday
was eight days, and Sunday there were great field-conventicles just by here, with great contempt
of the regular clergy, who complain extremely when I tell them I have no order to apprehend
anybody for past misdemeanours."[16] And this scrupulous observance of his orders, at a time
when a little excess of zeal was unlikely to be regarded as a very serious blunder, is yet
more strikingly illustrated in his next letter, written a week later from Dumfries. In that
town, at the southern end of the bridge over the Nith, the charity of some devout Covenanting
ladies had lately set up a large meeting-house. The clergy, as wild against the Covenanters
as Lauderdale himself, were very importunate with Claverhouse to demolish this hotbed of disaffection;
but he, though he confessed privately to his chief his annoyance at seeing a conventicle held
with impunity "at our nose," answered all importunities with a calm reference to his orders.
The southern end of the bridge was in Galloway, and in Galloway his commission did not run.
The authority of the Deputy-Sheriff of the shire was therefore called into play, and with his
countenance the offending building was quickly razed to the ground. In his report of this business
Claverhouse writes:--"My Lord, since I have seen the Act of Council, the scruple I had about
undertaking anything without the bounds of these two shires is indeed frivolous, but was not
so before. For if there had been no such act, it had not been safe for me to have done anything
but what my order warranted; and since I knew it not, it was to me the same thing as if it
had not been. And for my ignorance of it, I must acknowledge that till now, in any service
I have been, I never inquired further in the laws than the orders of my superior officers."
This will not be the only occasion on which Claverhouse will be found keeping strictly within
the lines of his commission, instead of, as he has been so frequently charged with doing, wantonly
and savagely exceeding it.

This Deputy-Sheriff (or Steward, as the phrase then ran) needs a word to himself, both on his
own account, as representing a certain phase of character unfortunately too common to the time,
and as the real author of many of the cruel deeds of which Claverhouse so long has borne the
blame. Sir Robert Grierson of Lag was regarded in his own district with an energy of hatred
to which even the terror inspired by Claverhouse gave place, and which has survived to a time
within the memory of men still living. In the early years of this century the most monstrous
traditions of his cruelty were still current, and are not yet wholly extinct. In a vaulted
chamber of the house in which he lived, on the English road some three miles south of Dumfries,
is still shown an iron hook from which he is said to have hung his Covenanting prisoners; and
a hill in the neighbourhood is still pointed out as that down which he used, for his amusement,
to send the poor wretches rolling in a barrel filled with knife-blades and iron spikes,--an
ingenious form of torture, commonly supposed to have been invented by the Carthaginians two
thousand years ago for the particular benefit of a Roman Consul. The dark and mysterious legend
of Sir Robert Redgauntlet, with which Wandering Willie beguiled the way to Brokenburn-foot,
was a popular tradition of Sir Robert Grierson, or Lag (as, in the familiar style of the day
he was more commonly called) in Scott's own lifetime: the fatal horseshoe, the birth-mark of
all the Redgauntlet line, was believed to be conspicuous on the foreheads of every true Grierson
in moments of anger; and it was a grandson of old Lag himself who sat to Scott for the portrait
of the elder Redgauntlet, the rugged and dangerous Herries of Birrenswark. Within the last
fifty years it was a custom of Halloween in many of the houses in Dumfriesshire and Galloway
to celebrate by a rude theatrical performance the evil memory of the Laird of Lag.[17]

Born of a family which had held lands in Dumfriesshire since the fifteenth century, and had
figured at various times on the troubled stage of Scottish history, Lag was undoubtedly a man
of some parts and capacity for public affairs, but coarse, cruel and brutal beyond even the
license of those times. The Covenanting historians charge him with vices such as even they
shrank from attributing to Claverhouse; and, careful as it is always necessary to be in taking
the evidence of such witnesses, it is abundantly clear that even these ingenious romancists
would have been hard put to it to stain the memory of Lag. Later historians have been sometimes
less careful in distinguishing between the two men. At least in one striking instance, the
misdeeds of this ruffian have been circumstantially charged to the account of his more famous
and important colleague.

It will be remembered that in the picture Macaulay has drawn of Claverhouse the soldiers under
his command, and by implication Claverhouse himself, figure as relieving their sterner duties
by a curious form of relaxation. They would call each other, he says, by the names of devils
and damned souls, mocking in their revels the torments of hell. The authority for this surprising
statement is Robert Wodrow, who was not born when Claverhouse returned to Scotland, and whose
history of the Scottish Church was not published till more than thirty years after the battle
of Killiecrankie.[18] Wodrow's work is very far from being the contemptible thing some apologists
for Claverhouse would have us believe; but he is not a witness whose unsupported testimony
it is always safe to take for gospel-truth. He wrote at a time when the naturally romantic
imagination of the Scottish peasantry, stimulated by the memories of old men who had known
the evil times, had largely embellished the facts he set himself to chronicle; and following
the fashion of his day (indeed, as one may say, the fashion of many historians who cannot plead
Wodrow's excuse), he was not always careful to separate the romance from the reality, even
where the latter might have better served his turn. But considering all the circumstances--the
circumstances of the time, of his subject, and of his own prepossessions, he is a writer whom
it is impossible to disregard; and, indeed, compared with the other Covenanting chroniclers
he stands apart as the most sober and impartial of historians. Where he got the story that
has been so ingeniously fashioned into an indictment against Claverhouse is not clear. The
passage runs as follows:--"Dreadful were the acts of wickedness done by the soldiers at this
time, and Lag was as deep as any. They used to take to themselves, in their cabals, the names
of devils and persons they supposed to be in hell, and with whips to lash one another, as a
jest upon hell. But I shall draw a veil over many of their dreadful impieties I meet with in
papers written at this time." This is not exactly the sort of evidence any judge but a hanging
judge would allow, though it would serve well enough the turn of a prosecutor. It is at any
rate evidence which no one, with any experience of the sort of gossip the annalists of the
Covenant were content to call history, would care to take seriously. But whatever its value
may really be, so far as it goes it is evidence not against Claverhouse but against Lag. It
is clear from Wodrow that the story refers not to the royal soldiers but to the local militia;
and a writer a little later than Wodrow makes it still more clear that the men supposed thus
to have disported themselves in their cups were those commanded by Lag. John Howie, an Ayrshire
peasant and a Cameronian of the strictest sect, who was not born till fourteen years after
Wodrow had published his history, has given Lag a particular place in the Index Expurgatorius
of his "Heroes for the Faith." There we may read how this "prime hero for the promoting of
Satan's kingdom" would, "with the rest of his boon companions and persecutors, feign themselves
devils, and those whom they supposed in hell, and then whip one another, as a jest upon that
place of torment." Claverhouse, as has been already shown, was himself singularly averse to
all rioting and drunkenness, as well as to profane amusements of every kind; and, as he was
indisputably one of the sternest disciplinarians who ever took or gave orders, it is unlikely
that he would have countenanced any such unseemly revels in the men under his command, with
whom, moreover, he was in these years thrown into unusually close personal contact. But, in
truth, the story, so far as he is concerned, is too foolish to need any solemn refutation.
It has been only examined at this length as furnishing a signal instance of the recklessness
with which the misdeeds of others have been fathered on him.[19]

The work Claverhouse now found to do must have been singularly distasteful to one who had seen
war on a great scale under such captains as William and Condé. It was at once undignified and
dangerous; and though danger was all to his taste, it was one thing to risk one's life in open
battle with enemies worthy of a soldier's steel, and another and very different thing to run
the chance of a stray bullet from behind a haystack or through a cottage window. The line of
country he had to patrol (for his work was really little more than that) was all too large
for the forces at his disposal. The enemies with whom he had mostly to deal were either old
men or women, for the Covenanters were well supplied with intelligence, and generally had ample
warning of his movements, quick and indefatigable as they were. "If your lordship give me any
new orders, I will beg they may be kept as secret as possible, and sent for me so suddenly
as the information some of the favourers of the fanatics are to send may be prevented."[20]
And again:

     "I obeyed the orders about seizing persons in Galloway that
     very night I received it, as far as it was possible; that is
     to say, all that was within forty miles, which is the most
     can be ridden in one night; and of six made search for, I
     found only two, which are John Livingston, bailie of
     Kirkcudbright, and John Black, treasurer there. The other
     two bailies were fled, and their wives lying above the
     clothes in the bed, and great candles lighted, waiting for
     the coming of the party, and told them, they knew of their
     coming, and had as good intelligence as they themselves; and
     that if the other two were seized on, it was their own
     faults, that would not contribute for intelligence. And the
     truth is, they had time enough to be advertised, for the
     order was dated the 15th, and came not to my hands till the
     20th. I laid the fellow in the guard that brought it, so
     soon as I considered the date, where he has lain ever since,
     and had it not been for respect to Mr. Maitland
     [Lauderdale's nephew] who recommended him to me I would have
     put him out of the troop with infamy."[21]

The letters written during the first months of his commission are full of warnings of this
sort. And he had other complaints to make, which must have been still more against the grain.
He was so inadequately supplied with money by the Council that he found it a hard matter to
pay his men, and harder still to pay the country people for the necessary provisions and forage;
for, so far from quartering his men at large upon the peasantry, he seems, at any rate in those
first months, to have been scrupulous to pay at the current rates for all he required to a
degree that matches rather with the niceties of modern warfare than the customs of those rough
times.

In March Claverhouse was appointed Deputy-Sheriff of Dumfriesshire by a particular warrant
from Whitehall, and Andrew Bruce of Earlshall, one of his lieutenants, was nominated with him.
This step gave great offence to Queensberry, who, as Sheriff of the shires of Dumfries and
Annandale, by law held all such patronage in his own hand, and marks the beginning of the petty
jealousy which from this time forward he seems to have shown to Claverhouse whenever he dared,
and which rose afterwards, as we shall see, to a serious height. But Queensberry was no match
for Lauderdale; and Claverhouse was duly settled in his new office, which, while strengthening
his hands and enabling him to dispense with many tedious formalities, at the same time considerably
increased his labours.

And so winter passed into spring, and still Claverhouse found no work more worthy of him than
patrolling the country, arranging for his men's quarters, examining suspected persons, and
endeavouring to persuade the Government to leave him not entirely penniless. More than once
he sent word to Edinburgh that he believed something serious was afoot. "I find," he writes
to Linlithgow on April 21st, "Mr. Welsh is accustoming both ends of the country to face the
king's forces, and certainly intends to break out into open rebellion." This Welsh is a famous
figure in Covenanting history. Grandson to a man whose name was long held in affectionate memory
by his party as that of the "incomparable John Welsh of Ayr," and great-grandson to no less
a hero than John Knox himself, he was on his own account a memorable man. He had inaugurated
the first conventicle, and had ever since been zealous in promoting them and officiating at
them among the wild hills and moorlands of the western shires, till his name had become a byword
among the soldiers for his courage in braving and his skill in evading them. But though one
of the most resolute and indefatigable of the ministers of the Covenant, he was also one of
the most moderate and sensible. Had no one among them been more eager than he to carry the
war into the enemy's country there had been no Bothwell Bridge. And, indeed, we shall find
him seriously taken to task by the more extreme of the party as a backslider from the good
cause for his endeavour to avert that disastrous affair.

Yet Claverhouse was right. Something very serious was soon to be afoot. During the last few
weeks the Covenanters had been notoriously growing bolder. They did not always now, as hitherto,
content themselves with evading the soldiers: they became in their turn the aggressors. More
than once an outlying post of Claverhouse's men had been fired upon; and on one occasion a
couple of the dragoons had been savagely murdered in cold blood. Even Wodrow found himself
forced to own that about this time "matters were running to sad heights among the armed followers
of some of the field meetings." But the trouble did not arise through John Welsh. It came through
a servant of the Crown who had been a sorer plague to his countrymen than a myriad of disaffected
ministers.

On May 5th, Lord Ross[22] from Lanark, and on the 6th Claverhouse from Dumfries, sent in their
despatches to the commander-in-chief at Edinburgh as usual. It is clear that neither of them
had at that time heard any rumour of an event which had happened a few days previously at no
very great distance from their quarters. On May 2nd the Primate of Scotland had been dragged
from his carriage as he was driving across an open heath three miles out of Saint Andrews,
and murdered in open day before the eyes of his daughter.

James Sharp, Archbishop of Saint Andrews, was at that time probably the best-hated man in Scotland.
Like all renegades he was in no favour even with his own party, though Lauderdale found after
trial that he could not dispense with his support. Even the moderate Presbyterians, who regarded
the uncompromising Covenanters as the real cause of their country's troubles, looked askance
upon Sharp, as the man whom they had chosen out of their number to save them and who had preferred
to save himself. By the Covenanters themselves he was assailed with every form of obloquy as
the Judas who had sold his God and his country for thirty pieces of silver, and who had hounded
on the servants of the King to spill the blood of the saints. Yet his murder was but an accident.
Eleven years before an attempt had, indeed, been made upon his life by one Mitchell, a fanatical
and apparently half-witted preacher, who was after a long delay put to the torture and finally
executed on a confession which he had been induced to make after a promise from the Privy Council
that his life should be spared. It is said that Lauderdale would have spared him, but Sharp
was so vehement for his death that the Duke dared not refuse.

The chief promoters of the Archbishop's murder were Hackston of Rathillet, Russell of Kettle,
and John Balfour of Burley, or, more correctly, of Kinloch. These three men were typical of
the class who at this time began to come to the front among the Covenanters, and by their incapacity,
folly, and brutality discredited and did their best to ruin a cause whose original justice
had been already too much obscured by such parasites. It is impossible to believe that they,
or such as they, were inspired by any strong religious feelings. Hackston and Balfour were
men of some fortune, who had been free-livers in their youth, and were now professing to expiate
those errors by a gloomy and ferocious asceticism. Both had a grudge against Sharp. Balfour
had been accused of malversation in the management of some property for which he was the Archbishop's
factor, and Hackston, his brother-in-law, had been arrested as his bail and forced to make
the money good. Russell, who has left a curiously minute and cold-blooded narrative of this
murder,[23] was a man of headstrong and fiery temper. They had all those dangerous gifts of
eloquence which, coarse and uncouth as it sounds to our ears, was, when liberally garnished
with texts of Scripture, precisely such as to inflame the heated tempers of an illiterate peasantry
to madness. It is important to distinguish men of this stamp from the genuine sufferers for
conscience' sake. The latter men were, indeed, often wrought up by their crafty leaders to
a pitch of blind and brutal fury which has done much to lessen the sympathy that is justly
theirs. But they were at the bottom simple, sincere, and pious; and they can at least plead
the excuse of a long and relentless persecution for acts which the others inspired and directed
for motives which it would be difficult, perhaps, to correctly analyse, but assuredly were
not founded on an unmixed love either for their country or their faith. Stripped of the veil
of religious enthusiasm which they knew so well how to assume, men of the stamp of Sharp's
murderers were in truth no other than those brawling and selfish demagogues whom times of stir
and revolution always have brought and always will bring to the front. There need, in these
days, be no difficulty in understanding the characters of men who dress Murder in the cloak
of Religion and call her Liberty.

Every child knows the story of the tragedy on Magus Moor. It will be enough here to remind
my readers, once more, that it was no preconcerted plan, but a pure accident--or, as the murderers
themselves called it, a gift from God. The men I have named, with a few others, were really
after one Carmichael, who had made himself particularly odious by his activity in collecting
the fines levied on the disaffected. But Carmichael, who was out hunting on the hills, had
got wind of their design and made his way home by another route. As the party were about to
separate in sullen disappointment, a messenger came to tell them that the Archbishop's coach
was in sight on the road to Saint Andrews. The opportunity was too good to be lost. Hackston
was asked to take the command, but declined, alleging his cause of quarrel with Sharp, which
would, he declared, "mar the glory of the action, for it would be imputed to his particular
revenge." But, he added, he would not leave them, nor "hinder them from what God had called
them to." Upon this, Balfour said, "Gentlemen, follow me;" and the whole party, some nine or
ten in number, rode off after the carriage, which could be seen in the distance labouring heavily
over the rugged track that traversed the lonely expanse of heath. How the butcher's work was
done: how Sharp crawled on his knees to Hackston, saying, "You are a gentleman--you will protect
me," and how Hackston answered, "Sir, I shall never lay a hand on you": how Balfour and the
rest then drew their swords and finished what their pistols had begun; and how the daughter
was herself wounded in her efforts to cover the body of her father--these things are familiar
to all.

From May 6th to 29th no letters from Claverhouse have survived; but on the latter date he sent
a short despatch from Falkirk, announcing his intention of joining his forces with Lord Ross
to scatter a conventicle of eighteen parishes which, he had just received news, were about
(on the following Sunday) to meet at Kilbryde Moor, four miles from Glasgow. The following
Sunday was June 1st, on which day Claverhouse was indeed engaged with a conventicle; but in
a fashion very different from any he had anticipated.

CHAPTER IV.

The die was now fairly cast. In a general rising lay the only hope of safety for Sharp's murderers.
Desperate themselves, they determined to carry others with them along the same path, and by
some signal show of defiance commit the party to immediate and irretrievable action. The occasion
for this was easily found. May 29th, the King's birthday, had been, as already mentioned, appointed
as a general day of rejoicing for his restoration. This had from the first given offence as
well to those members of the Presbyterian Church who saw in his Majesty's return no particular
cause for joy, as to those more ascetic spirits who objected on principle to all holidays.
May 29th was therefore hailed as the day divinely marked, as it were, for the purpose on hand,
a crowning challenge to the King's authority.

The business was put in charge of Robert Hamilton, a man of good birth and education, but violent
and rash, without any capacity for command and, if some of his own side may be trusted, of
no very certain courage. With him went Thomas Douglas, one of the fire-breathing ministers,
Balfour and Russell and some seventy or eighty armed men. Glasgow had been originally chosen
for the scene of operations; but a day or two previously a detachment of Claverhouse's troopers
had marched into that city from Falkirk, and the little town of Rutherglen, about two miles
to the west of Glasgow, was chosen instead.

On the afternoon of the 29th Hamilton and his party made their appearance in Rutherglen. They
first extinguished the bonfire that was blazing in the King's honour; and, having then lit
one on their own account, proceeded solemnly to burn all the Acts of Parliament and Royal Proclamations
that had been issued in Scotland since Charles's return. A paper was next read, containing
a vigorous protest against all interferences of the English Government with the Presbyterian
religion, and especially those subsequent to the Restoration. This paper, which was styled
the Declaration and Testimony of some of the true Presbyterian party in Scotland, was then
nailed to the market-cross of the little town, and the party withdrew. All this, be it remembered,
was done within only two miles of the royal forces, some of whom, it is said, were actually
spectators of the whole affair at scarce musket-shot's distance. It was fortunate for the party
that Claverhouse was not in Glasgow at the time.

He was then in Falkirk, from which place he had, as we have seen, written to Linlithgow on
the very day of the Rutherglen business of a rumour he had heard of some particular gathering
appointed for the following Sunday, June 1st. Though he did not believe it, he thought it well
to join forces with Ross in case there might be need for action. This was done at Glasgow on
Saturday; and at once Claverhouse set off for Rutherglen to inquire into the affair of the
29th. As soon as he had got the names of the ringleaders he sent patrols out to scour the neighbourhood
for them. A few prisoners were picked up, and among them one King, a noted orator of the conventicles,
formerly chaplain to Lord Cardross, whose service he had left, it is said, on account of a
little misadventure with one of the maid-servants. The troops halted for the night at Strathavon,
and early next morning set off with their prisoners for Glasgow. On the way Claverhouse determined
on "a little tour, to see if we could fall upon a conventicle," which, he ingenuously adds,
"we did, little to our advantage."

During his search for the Rutherglen men he had heard more of the plans for Sunday. It was
clear something was in the air, and report named Loudon Hill as the place of business, a steep
and rocky eminence marking the spot where the shires of Ayr, Lanark, and Renfrew meet. To Loudon
Hill accordingly Claverhouse turned his march, and soon found that rumour had for once not
exaggerated.

Two miles to the east of the hill lies the little hamlet and farm of Drumclog, even now but
sparsely covered with coarse meadow-grass, and then no more than a barren stretch of swampy
moorland. South and north the ground sloped gently down towards a marshy bottom through which
ran a stream, or dyke, fringed with stunted alder-bushes. On the foot of the southern slope,
across the dyke, the Covenanters were drawn up; and the practised eye of Claverhouse saw at
a glance that they had gathered there not to pray but to fight. "When we came in sight of them,"
he wrote to Linlithgow, "we found them drawn up in battle upon a most advantageous ground,
to which there was no coming but through mosses and lakes. They were not preaching, and had
got away all their women and children."[24] They were ranged in three lines: those who had
firearms being placed nearest to the dyke, behind them a body of pikemen, and in the rear the
rest, armed with scythes set on poles, pitchforks, goads and other such rustic weapons. On
either flank was a small body of mounted men. Hamilton was in command: Burley had charge of
the horse; and among others present that day was William Cleland, then but sixteen years old,
and destined ten years later to win a nobler title to fame by a glorious death at the head
of his Cameronians in the memorable defence of Dunkeld.

As usual, it is impossible to estimate with any exactness the strength of either side. According
to one of their own party, who was present, the Covenanters did not exceed two hundred and
fifty fighting men, of whom fifty were mounted and the same proportion armed with guns. These
numbers have been accepted, of course, by Wodrow, and also by Dr. Burton. But within a week
this handful had, on Hamilton's own testimony, grown to six thousand horse and foot; and though,
no doubt, the success at Drumclog would have materially swelled the Covenanting ranks, if they
were only two hundred and fifty on that day, the most liberal calculation can hardly accept
the numbers said to have been gathered on Glasgow Moor six days later. Probably, if we increase
the former total and diminish the latter, we shall get nearer the mark; but it is impossible
to do more than conjecture. Sharpe, in the fragment printed by Napier, rates Hamilton's force
at six hundred. Claverhouse's own estimate was "four battalions of foot, and all well armed
with fusils and pitchforks, and three squadrons of horse." His experience was more likely to
serve him in such matters than the untrained calculations of men who were, moreover, naturally
concerned to magnify the defeat of the King's troops as much as possible; while it is clear
from the tone of his own despatch, which is singularly literal and straightforward, that he
had no wish, and did not even conceive it necessary, to excuse his disaster. But here again
the estimate helps us little, owing to the vague use of the terms battalion and squadron. For
the same reason we can but guess at the strength of the royal force. In the writings of the
time Claverhouse's command is indiscriminately styled a regiment and a troop. It is certain
that he was the responsible officer, so that, whatever its numerical strength, he stood to
the body of men he commanded in the relation that a colonel stands to his regiment. But it
is probable that his regiment, with those commanded by Home and Airlie, were practically considered
as the three troops of the Royal Scottish Life Guards of whom the young Marquis of Montrose
was colonel. From a royal warrant of 1672, it appears that a troop of dragoons was rated at
eighty men, exclusive of officers, and that a regiment was to consist of twelve troops. But
it is hardly possible that this strength was ever reached. From a passage in the third chapter
of Macaulay's history it does not seem as if the full complement of a regiment of cavalry can
have much exceeded four hundred men; but, I repeat, the indiscriminate use of the terms troop
and regiment, battalion and squadron, makes all calculations theoretical and vague.[25] Scott
puts the King's forces at Drumclog at two hundred and fifty men; and, as a detachment had been
left behind in garrison with Ross's men at Glasgow, this is probably not over the mark, if
Macaulay's estimate of a regiment be correct. He also, in the report Lord Evandale makes to
his chief, rates the Covenanters at near a thousand fighting men, which would probably tally
with Claverhouse's estimate. But, whatever the strength of either side may have been, it is
tolerably certain that the advantage that way was on the side of the Covenanters.

The description of the fight in "Old Mortality" is an admirable specimen of the style in which
Scott's genius could work the scantiest materials to his will. All contemporary accounts of
the fray are singularly meagre and confused; and, indeed, the art of describing a battle was
then very much in its infancy. It is difficult, from Claverhouse's own despatch, to get more
than a general idea of the affair, which was probably after the first few minutes but an indiscriminate
_mêlée_. No doubt it was his consciousness of some lack of clearness that inspired his apologetic
postscript: "My Lord, I am so wearied and so sleepy that I have written this very confusedly."
The flag of truce, which in the novel Claverhouse sends down under charge of his nephew Cornet
Graham to parley with the Covenanters, was of Scott's own making, though it seems that a couple
of troopers were despatched in advance to survey the ground. Nor does Claverhouse mention any
kinsman of his, or any one of his name, as having fallen that day: the only two officers he
specifies are Captain Blyth and Cornet Crafford, or Crawford, both of whom were killed by Hamilton's
first fire. But though Claverhouse mentions no one of his own name, others do. By more than
one contemporary writer one Robert Graham is included among the slain. It is said that while
at breakfast that morning in Strathavon he had refused his dog meat, promising it a full meal
off the Whigs' bodies before night; "but instead of that," runs the tale, "his dog was seen
eating his own thrapple (for he was killed) by several." Another version is, that the Covenanters,
finding the name of Graham wrought in the neck of the shirt, savagely mangled the dead body,
supposing it to be that of Claverhouse himself.[26]

But to come from tradition to fact. The affair began with a sharp skirmish of musketry on both
sides. To every regiment of cavalry there were then joined a certain proportion of dragoons
who seem to have held much the position of our mounted infantry, men skilled in the use of
firearms and accustomed to fight as well on foot as in the saddle. A party of these advanced
in open order down the hill to the brink of the dyke and opened a smart fire on the Covenanters,
who answered with spirit, but both in their weapons and skill were naturally far inferior to
the royal soldiers. Meanwhile, some troopers had been sent out to skirmish on either flank,
and to try for a crossing. This they could not find; but, unable to manoeuvre in the swampy
ground, found instead that their saddles were emptying fast. Then Hamilton, seeing that his
men were no match at long bowls for the dragoons, and marking the confusion among the cavalry,
gave the word to advance. By crossings known only to themselves Burley led the horse over the
dyke on one flank, while young Cleland followed with the bulk of the foot on the other. Claverhouse
thereupon called in his skirmishers, and, advancing his main body down the hill, the engagement
became general. But in that heavy ground the footmen had all the best of it. The scythes and
pitchforks made sad work among the poor floundering horses. His own charger was so badly wounded
that, in the rider's forcible language, "its guts hung out half an ell;" yet the brave beast
carried him safely out of the press.[27] The troopers began to fall back, and Burley, coming
up on sound ground with his horse, flung himself on them so hotly that the retreat became something
very like a rout. Claverhouse, to whose courage and energy that day his enemies bear grudging
witness, did all that a brave captain could, but his men had now got completely out of hand.
"I saved the standards" (one of which had been for a moment taken) "and made the best retreat
the confusion of our people would suffer." So he wrote to Linlithgow, but he made no attempt
to disguise his defeat. He owns to having lost eight or ten men among the cavalry, besides
wounded; and the dragoons lost many more. Only five or six of the Covenanters seem to have
fallen, among whom was one of Sharp's murderers. This does not speak very well for their opponents'
fire; but then we have only the testimony of their own historians to go by. Claverhouse himself
could say no more than that "they are not come easily off on the other side, for I saw several
of them fall before we came to the shock."

Pell-mell went the rout over the hill and across the moorland to Strathavon, through which
the Life Guards had marched but a few hours before in all their bravery. As their captain passed
by the place where his prisoner of the morning, John King, was now lustily chanting a psalm
of triumph, the reverend gentleman called out to him, with audacity worthy of Gabriel Kettledrummle,
"to stay the afternoon sermon." At Strathavon the townspeople drew out to bar their passage,
but the fear of their pursuers lent the flying troopers fresh heart: "we took courage," writes
Claverhouse, "and fell to them, made them run, leaving a dozen on the place." Through Strathavon
they clattered, and never drew rein till they found themselves safe in Glasgow among their
own comrades.

Fortunately the pursuit had slackened, or it might have gone ill with the garrison in Glasgow.
Claverhouse's men had no doubt fine tales to tell of the fury of the Whig devils behind them;
and had Hamilton been strong enough in cavalry to enter the town at the heels of the flying
troopers it is not likely that he would have met with much opposition. The pursuit, however,
did not follow far. Thanksgivings had to be made for the victory, and the prisoners to be looked
to. All these, according to Wodrow, were let go after being disarmed; but Hamilton himself
tells a very different tale. His orders had been strict that there should be no quarter that
day; but on his return from the pursuit he found that his orders had been disobeyed. Five prisoners
had been dismissed, and were already out of his reach: two others were waiting while their
captors debated on their fate. Then Hamilton, furious that any of "Babel's brats" should be
let go, slew one of these with his own hand, to stay any such unreasonable spirit of mercy,
"lest the Lord would not honour us to do much more for him."[28]

That night the Covenanting captains stayed at Lord Loudon's house, where, though the master
had deemed it prudent to keep out of the way, they were hospitably entertained by her ladyship.
The next morning they continued their march to Glasgow.

Claverhouse was ready for them. The town was too open a place to be properly barricaded, but
he had caused some sort of breastwork to be raised near the market-cross as cover for his men,
and patrols had been out since daybreak to watch Hamilton's movements. That worthy was reported
to be dividing his men into two bodies, one of which presently marched on the town by the Gallowgate
bridge, while the other took a much longer route by the High Church and College. It was thus
possible to deal with the first before the latter could come to its assistance. This was very
effectually done. About ten in the morning the attack was made by way of the bridge, led by
Hamilton in person.[29] But the welcome which met them from the barricades was too warm for
the Covenanters. They broke and fled at the first fire, Claverhouse and Ross at the head of
their men chasing them out of the town. Meanwhile, their comrades, descending the hill on the
other side, saw what was going on, and, having no mind for a similar welcome, turned about
and made off by the way they had come. The two parties joined and halted for a while at the
place they had occupied on the previous night; but when they heard Claverhouse's trumpets sounding
again to horse they fell back to Hamilton Park, where it was not thought prudent to follow them.

but not till three years after Drumclog.

[29] It was reported by some of his own party that as his men entered the town Hamilton withdrew
into a house at the Gallowgate to wait the issue. But it would be no more fair to take this
report for truth than it would be to assume that Claverhouse really forbad burial to the dead
Whigs, that the dogs might eat them where they lay in the streets. There was too much quarrelling
in the Covenanting camp to allow us to take for granted all their judgments on each other when
unfavourable; and at Drumclog Hamilton seems by all accounts to have borne himself bravely
enough, whatever he may have done subsequently.

CHAPTER V.

There is no letter from Claverhouse in this year, 1679, later than that reporting the defeat
at Drumclog. There was, indeed, no occasion for him to write. As soon as the news of his defeat
and the attack on Glasgow had reached the Council, orders were at once sent for the forces
to withdraw from the latter place and join Linlithgow at Stirling. After Bothwell Bridge had
been won he was sent again into the West on the weary work that we have already seen him employed
on. But during the intervening time his independent command had ceased. At the same time there
is no reason to suppose that he was in any disgrace for the defeat at Drumclog. He had committed
the fault, not uncommon, as military history teaches, with more experienced leaders than Claverhouse,
of holding his foe too cheaply: he had committed this fault, and he had paid the penalty. There
is some vague story of a sealed commission not to be opened till in the presence of the enemy,
and when opened on the slope of Drumclog containing strict orders to give battle wherever and
whenever the chance might serve. But the story rests on too slight authority to count for much.
His own temperament would have made him fight without any sealed orders; and, indeed, he had
not long before written to Linlithgow that he was determined to do so on the first occasion,
and had warned his men to that effect. The wisdom of his resolve is clear. Disgusted with their
work, discontented with the hardness of their fare and the infrequency of their pay, in perpetual
danger of their lives from unseen enemies, his soldiers were getting out of hand. Claverhouse
was the sternest of disciplinarians; but the discipline of those days was a very different
thing from our interpretation of the word. It was more a recognition by the soldier of the
superior strength and possibilities of his officer, than trained obedience to an inevitable
law. When they once had satisfied themselves that their captain was unable to bring the enemy
to book, was unable even to provide them with proper rations and pay, no love for the flag
would have kept them together for another hour. It was essential for Claverhouse to show them
that he and they were more than a match for their foes whenever and in whatever form the opportunity
came. Unfortunately for him it came in the form of Drumclog, and the proof had still to be given.

But it is abundantly clear that no stain was considered to rest either on his honour or his
skill. The only ungenerous reference to his discomfiture came a few years later in the shape
of a growl from old Dalziel against the folly of splitting the army up into small detachments
at the discretion of rash and incompetent leaders. Claverhouse was removed from his independent
command only because the circumstances of the moment made it necessary. When it was found necessary
to despatch a regular army against the insurgents (as, for all their provocation, they must
after Drumclog be styled), he took his proper place in that army as captain of a troop in the
Royal Scottish Life Guards. When the brief campaign had closed at Bothwell Bridge, and, worst
fortune for him, affairs had resumed their original complexion, he went back to his old position.

It will be necessary, then, to supply this gap in Claverhouse's correspondence by a brief review
of the state of things from the battle of Drumclog to the date of his new commission.

The garrison of Glasgow had, as we have seen, joined Linlithgow at Stirling. There they lay
for a day or two till orders were received from the Council for the whole army, which only
numbered about eighteen hundred men in all, to fall back on Edinburgh. In the capital the greatest
consternation reigned. The first proceeding of the Council was to proclaim the rising "an open,
manifest, and horrid rebellion," and all the insurgents were summoned to surrender at discretion
as "desperate and incorrigible traitors." Having thus satisfied their diplomatic consciences
they wisely proceeded to more practical measures. The militia was called out, horse and foot,
in all the Lowlands, save in the disaffected shires. For those north of the Forth the rendezvous
was at Stirling, for those south on the links of Leith. Each man was to bring provisions with
him for ten days. The magistrates were ordered to remove all the powder and other munitions
of war they could find in the city to the Castle. An armed guard was stationed night and day
in the Canongate, and another in the Abbey. Finally, a post was sent to London on Linlithgow's
advice to urge the instant despatch of more troops, and two shillings and sixpence a day of
extra pay was promised to every foot soldier.

They were not disturbed in their preparations. The Covenanters were too busy with their own
affairs to take much heed what their enemies might be doing. They did, indeed, march into Glasgow,
but beyond shooting a poor wretch whom they vowed they recognised as having fought against
them on the 2nd, and possibly indulging in a little looting, they did nothing. They did not
stay long in the town. Plans they seem to have had none, nor any settled organisation or discipline.
Moving restlessly about the neighbourhood from village to village and from moor to moor, their
preachers exhorted and harangued as much against each other as against Pope or Prelate, and
their leaders quarrelled as though there were not a King's soldier in all Scotland, nor Claverhouse
within a dozen miles of them eager for the moment to strike. There was no lack of arms among
them, and their numbers seem at this time to have been not far short of eight thousand. But
no men of any position or influence in the country had joined them with the exception of Hamilton;
and his authority, whether the story of his cowardice at Glasgow be true or not, was not what
it had been at Rutherglen and Drumclog. The preachers seemed to have exercised the only control
over the rabble; and such control, as was natural, seems rarely to have lasted beyond the length
of their sermons, which, indeed, were not commonly short. As the Covenanters (to keep to the
distinguishing name I have chosen) were an extreme section of the Presbyterians, so now the
Covenanters themselves were divided into a moderate and an extreme party. The chiefs of the
former, or Erastians as their opponents scornfully termed them, were John Welsh and David Hume.
Of Hume there is no particular account, but Welsh we have met before. Though he had been under
denunciation as a rebel ever since the Pentland rising (in which he had, indeed, borne no part),
he had never given his voice for war; and, though assuredly neither a coward nor a trimmer,
had always kept from any active share in the proceedings of his more tumultuous brethren. His
plan, and the plan of the few who at that time and place were on his side, was temperate and
reasonable. They asked for no more than they were willing to give. Against the King, his government,
and his bishops they had no quarrel, if only they were suffered to worship God after their
own fashion. Though they themselves had not accepted the Indulgence, they were not disposed
to be unduly severe with those who had. In a word, they were willing to extend to all men the
liberty they demanded for themselves. Had there been more of this wise mind among the Covenanters--among
the Presbyterians, one may indeed say--though it is hardly possible to believe that Lauderdale
and his crew would not still have found occasion for oppression, it would be much easier to
find sympathy for the oppressed.

On the other side, Hamilton himself, Donald Cargill, and Thomas Douglas were the most conspicuous
in words, while Hackston, Burley, and the rest of Sharp's murderers were, of course, with them.
Hamilton and Douglas we know. Cargill, like Douglas, was a minister: he had received a good
education at Aberdeen and Saint Andrews, but had soon fallen into disgrace for the disloyalty
and virulence of his language. In a sermon on the anniversary of the Restoration he had declared
from his pulpit that the King's name should "stink while the world stands for treachery, tyranny,
and lechery."[30] In this party all was confused, extravagant, fierce, unreasoning. What they
wanted, what they were fighting to get, from whom they expected to get it, even their own historians
are unable to explain, and probably they themselves had no very clear notions. They talked
of liberty, by which they seem to have meant no more than liberty to kill all who on any point
thought otherwise than they did: of freedom, which meant freedom from all laws save their own
passions: of the God of their fathers, and every day they violated alike His precepts and their
practice. To slay and spare not was their watchword; but whom they were to slay, or what was
to be gained or done when the slaying was accomplished, no two men among them were agreed.
For the moment the current of their fury seems to have set most strongly against the Indulgence
and those who had accepted its terms. A single instance will show pretty clearly the state
of insubordination into which those unhappy men had fallen. It was announced that one Rae,
a favourite expounder on the moderate side, was about to preach on a certain day in camp. Hamilton,
who still retained the nominal command, sent him a letter bidding him not spare the Indulgence.
To this Rae, who does not seem himself to have been in any position of authority, made answer
that Hamilton had better mind what belonged to him, and not go beyond his sphere and station.[31]
It would not be difficult to draw a parallel between the condition of the Covenanting camp
at that time and the so-called Irish Party of our own time. Indeed, if any body will be at
the trouble to examine the contemporary accounts of Hamilton and his followers, and particularly
their language, much of which has been faithfully chronicled by their admirers, they will be
surprised to find how closely the parallel may be pushed.

Meanwhile, on the other side preparations went briskly forward. A strong detachment of regular
troops was at once despatched from London, with the young Duke of Monmouth himself in command.
Great pains have been taken both by contemporary and later writers to explain the reason of
this appointment. It was designed, they have said, to render him unpopular in Scotland. It
is certainly possible that he might have been sent to Scotland to get him out of the way of
his admirers in England, who just at that time were somewhat inconveniently noisy in their
admiration. But the appointment does not seem to need any very subtle explanation. Monmouth
was the King's favourite son. He had served his apprenticeship to the trade of war in the Low
Countries, and under such captains as Turenne and William of Orange. He was popular with the
people for his personal courage, his good looks, his pleasant manners, and above all for his
Protestantism--a matter with him possibly more of policy than principle, but which served among
the common people to gain him the affectionate nickname of The Protestant Duke, and to distinguish
him in their eyes as the natural antagonist to the unpopular and Popish James. With all his
faults Monmouth was no tyrant, and Charles himself was rather careless than cruel. This appointment,
therefore, was taken in Scotland to signify a disposition on the King's part to employ gentle
means if possible with the insurgents, and as such was not altogether approved of. Gentle means
were not much to the taste of the presiding spirits of the Council-Board at Edinburgh, whose
native ferocity had certainly not been softened by the fright and confusion of the last few
days. It was particularly requested, therefore, that Dalziel might be named second in command,
who might well be trusted to counteract any unseasonable leniency on Monmouth's part. Fortunately
for the insurgents the old savage did not receive his commission till the day after the battle.

Monmouth left London on June 15th and reached Edinburgh on the 18th. He at once took the field.
Montrose commanded the cavalry, Linlithgow the foot: Claverhouse rode at the head of his troop
under his kinsman, and the Earls of Home and Airlie were there in charge of their respective
troops: Mar held a command of foot. Many other Scotch noblemen and gentlemen of position followed
the army as volunteers. Some Highlanders and a considerable body of militia made up a force
which has been put as high as fifteen thousand men, but probably did not exceed half that number.

The near approach of the royal troops only increased the quarrelling and confusion in the insurgent
camp, which was pitched now at Hamilton. Some friends at Edinburgh had sent word to them that
Monmouth might be found not indisposed to treat; and that it would be best for them to stand
off for a while, and not on any account be drawn into fighting. But the idea of treating only
inflamed the more violent. On the 21st a council was called which began in mutual recrimination
and abuse, and ended in a furious quarrel. Hamilton drew his sword, vociferating that it was
drawn as much against the King's curates and the minions of the Indulgence as against the English
dragoons, and left the meeting followed by Cargill, Douglas and the more violent of his party.
Disgusted with the scene, and convinced of the hopelessness of a cause supported by such men,
many left the camp and returned to their own homes. Welsh and the moderate leaders resolved
to take matters into their own hands. On the morning of the 22nd Monmouth had reached Bothwell.
His advance guard held the little town about a quarter of a mile distant from the river: his
main body was encamped on the moor. Shortly after daybreak he was surprised by a visit from
Welsh, Hume and another of their party, Fergusson of Caitloch. Monmouth received them courteously,
and heard them with patience while they read to him a paper (known in Covenanting annals as
the Hamilton Declaration) they had drawn up detailing their grievances and their demands. The
first were indisputable: the second were, as has been said, moderate. Monmouth was, however,
forced to answer that he could not treat with armed rebels. If they would lay down their arms
and surrender at discretion, he promised to do all he could to gain them not only present pardon
but tolerance in the future. Meanwhile, he said, they had best return to their camp, report
his message, and bring him back an answer within half an hour's time. They returned, only to
find confusion worse confounded, and their own lives even in some danger from the furious Hamilton.

The half-hour passed, and no further sign of submission was made. Monmouth bid the advance
be sounded, and the Foot Guards, commanded by young Livingstone, Linlithgow's eldest son, moved
down to the bridge. Just at that spot the Clyde is deep and narrow, running swiftly between
steep banks fringed on the western side with bushes of alder and hazel. The bridge itself was
only twelve feet wide, and guarded in the centre with a gate-house. The post was a strong one
for defence, and had there been any military skill, or even unity of purpose, among the defendants,
Monmouth would have had to buy his passage dear. Hackston of Rathillet had thrown himself with
a small body of determined men into the gate-house, while Burley, with a few who could hold
their muskets straight, took up his post among the alder-bushes. The rest stood idly by while
their comrades fought. For about an hour Hackston held the gate till his powder was spent.
He sent to Hamilton for more, or for fresh troops, but the only answer he received was an order
to retire. He had no choice but to fall back on the main body, which he found at that supreme
moment busily engaged in cashiering their officers, and quarrelling over the choice of new
ones. The English foot then crossed the bridge: Monmouth followed leisurely at the head of
the horse, while his cannon played from the eastern bank on the disordered masses of the Covenanters.
A few Galloway men, better mounted and officered than the rest of their fellows, spurred out
against the Life Guards as they were filing off the narrow bridge, but were at once ordered
back by Hamilton. The rest of the horse in taking up fresh ground to avoid the English cannon
completed the disorder of the foot--if, indeed, anything were wanted to complete the disorder
of a rabble which had never known the meaning of the word order; and a general forward movement
of the royal troops, who had now all passed the bridge, gave the signal for flight. Hamilton
was the first to obey it, thus, in the words of an eye-witness, "leaving the world to debate
whether he acted most like a traitor, a coward, or a fool."[32] Twelve hundred of the poor
wretches surrendered at discretion: the rest fled in all directions. Monmouth ordered quarter
to be given to all who asked it, and there is no doubt that he was able considerably to diminish
the slaughter. Comparatively few fell at the bridge, but four or five hundred are said to have
fallen, "murdered up and down the fields," says Wodrow, "wherever the soldiers met them, without
mercy." Mercy was not a conspicuous quality of the soldiery of those days; and the discovery
of a huge gallows in the insurgents' camp, with a cartload of new ropes at the foot, was not
likely to stay the hands of men who knew well enough that had the fortune of war been different
those ropes would have been round their necks without any mercy. But it is clear that Monmouth
was able to save many. When Dalziel arrived next day in camp and learned how things had gone,
he rebuked the Duke to his face for betraying his command. "Had I come a day sooner," he said,
"these rogues should never have troubled his majesty or the kingdom any more."[33]

There is no authority for attributing to Claverhouse himself any particular ferocity. We may
be pretty sure that the Covenanting chroniclers would not have refrained from another fling
at their favourite scapegoat could they have found a stone to their hand; but as a matter of
fact, in no account of the battle is he mentioned, save by name only, as having been present
with his troop in Monmouth's army. The fiery and vindictive part assigned to him by Scott rests
on the authority of the most amazing tissue of absurdities ever woven out of the inventive
fancy of a ballad-monger.[34] He had no kinsman's death to avenge, and he was too good a soldier
to directly disobey his chief's orders, however little they may have been to his taste.

There is, moreover, positive evidence to the contrary. Six years after the battle one Robert
Smith, of Dunscore, who had been among the rebel horsemen at Bothwell, deposed that as they,
some sixteen hundred in number, were in retreat towards Carrick, he saw the royal cavalry halted
within less than a mile from the field, and this was considered by the fugitives to have been
done to favour their escape. "For," he went on, "if they had followed us they had certainly
killed or taken us all." It is clear, therefore, that whatever Claverhouse might have done
had he been left to himself, or whatever he may have wished to do--what he did do was, in common
with the rest of the army, to obey his superior's orders.

Claverhouse is represented as posting off to London from the field of battle and, by means
of false witnesses, bringing Monmouth to the scaffold as a traitor who had given quarter to
the King's enemies. Sir Walter, of course, knew very well what he was about; but it did not
seem to him necessary to write fiction with the nice exactness of the historian; nor was he,
happily for us, of that scrupulous order of minds which conceives that a cruel wrong has been
done to the reputation of a man who has been in his grave for nearly a century and a half by
employing the colours of tradition to heighten the pictures of fancy.

CHAPTER VI.

Could Monmouth's influence have lasted, their defeat at Bothwell Bridge might have turned out
well for the Covenanters. As soon as he had led his army back into quarters, he hastened to
London, where he so strongly represented the brutal folly and mismanagement of Lauderdale's
government, that he prevailed upon the King to try once more the effect of gentler measures.
An indemnity was granted for the past, and even some limited form of indulgence for the future.
But the unexpected return of the Duke of York from Holland put an end to all these humane counsels.
Monmouth was himself soon again in disgrace; and Lauderdale, though his power was now past
its height, was still strong enough to mould to his own will concessions for which the time
had now perhaps irrevocably gone.

The twelve hundred prisoners from Bothwell were marched in chains to Edinburgh, and penned
like sheep in the churchyard of the Grey Friars, the building which barely forty years before
had witnessed the triumphant birth of that Covenant which was, if ever covenant of man was,
assuredly to be baptized in blood. Two of them, and both ministers, were immediately executed:
five others, as though to appease the cruel ghost of Sharp, were hanged on Magus Moor: of the
rest, the most part were set at liberty on giving bonds for their future good behaviour, while
the more obstinate were shipped off to the plantations.

Claverhouse was now sent back to his old employment. Though none of his own letters of this
time have survived, it is clear from an Order of the Privy Council that shortly after the affair
at Bothwell he was again entrusted with the control of the rebellious shires. There is unfortunately
no record of his own by which it is possible to check the vague charges of Wodrow, who wisely
declines to commit himself to particulars on the ground that "multitudes of instances, once
flagrant, are now at this distance lost," while not a few, he candidly admits, "were never
distinctly known." In the rare cases in which he becomes more specific in his complaints, he
does not make it clear that the offences were committed in Claverhouse's presence, nor even
that they were always committed by soldiers of his troop--"the soldiers under Claverhouse"
seem to stand with him for all the royal forces then employed in the western shires. That what
he calls "spulies, depredations, and violences" were committed on Claverhouse's authority may
be freely granted: they were precisely such as a strict obedience to the letter (and no less
to the spirit) of his commission would have enjoined--the levying of fines, the seizure of
arms, horses, and other movable property from all suspected of any share in the rebellion who
would not absolve themselves by taking the oath of abjuration, and from all resetters, or harbourers,
of known rebels. It would be idle to refuse to believe that many unjust and cruel acts were
not committed at this time, as we know they were committed subsequently, merely because they
cannot be succinctly proved. It is unlikely that Claverhouse himself wasted over-much time
on sifting every case that was brought in to him by his spies; and where he was not himself
present--and it must be remembered that he was not the only officer engaged in this service,
and also that his own soldiers were often employed under his lieutenants on duties he was personally
unable to attend to--it is hard to doubt that much wild and brutal work went on. The whole
case, in short, except in a very few instances (which will be examined elsewhere), is one solely
of hearsay and tradition; and it is no more than common justice in any attempt to define Claverhouse's
share in it, to give him the benefit of the doubt where it is not directly contrary to the
proved facts and the evidence of his despatches. For Claverhouse, it should be also and always
remembered, may be implicitly trusted to speak the truth in these matters, for the simple reason
that he was not in the least ashamed of his work. We may well believe that it was not the work
he would have chosen; but it was the work he had been set to do; and his concern was only to
execute it as completely as possible. He was a soldier, obeying the orders of his superiors,
for which they and they only were responsible. That their orders matched with his feelings,
religious as well as political, for Claverhouse was as thorough in his devotion to the Church
as he was in his devotion to the Crown, mattered nothing. The whole question was to him one
of military obedience. Sorely as he may have chafed at the order, he halted his troopers on
the banks of the Clyde when Monmouth's trumpets sounded the recall, with the same readiness
and composure that he showed in leading them to the charge down the slopes of Drumclog; and
he would have led them against his brothers-in-arms Ross or James Douglas, had they turned
rebels, as straightly and keenly as he led them against Hamilton and Burley. At the same time
both his letters and his actions show that he did his best to discriminate between the ringleaders
and the crowd: between the brawling demagogues or the meddlesome priests and the honest ignorant
peasants, whose only crime was that they wished to worship God after a fashion the Government
chose to discountenance. It is not necessary to assume that he was moved thereto by any softness
of heart: common-sense, and a sense, too, of justice, would suffice to show him where to strike.
And it will hereafter be seen that, where his commission was large enough, he more than once
exercised a discretion not entirely to the taste of the more thorough-going zealots of the
Edinburgh Council-board.

The only distinct evidence we have of him at this time is contained in the aforesaid Orders
of Council. From these it appears that he had been charged by the Scottish Treasury with appropriating
the public moneys to his use. He had been appointed for his services trustee to the Crown of
the estate of one Macdowall of Freugh, an outlawed Galloway laird; and of this estate it was
alleged that he would render no accounts, nor of the fines he had been commissioned to levy
on the non-abjuring rebels. With characteristic fearlessness Claverhouse went straight to London,
and in a personal interview satisfied Charles of his innocence, who forthwith ordered him to
be reinstated in his commission and all the privileges belonging to it.[35] It is clear, however,
that during the greater part of the year 1680 Claverhouse was suspended from both his civil
and military employments, and this will account for the duty of punishing the authors of the
Sanquhar Declaration devolving not upon him, but upon his lieutenant, Bruce of Earlshall.

The prime mover of the Sanquhar Declaration was Richard Cameron, who had now become the head
of the extreme party, henceforth to be known by his name--a name which still survives as that
of a distinguished regiment of the British army. It was framed in much the same language and
to much the same purpose as its predecessor of Rutherglen, though it would not be right to
degrade Cameron to the level of Hamilton and his ruffianly associates. It took its title from
having been fixed to the market-cross of Sanquhar, a small town in Dumfriesshire, on June 22nd,
1680. Exactly a month later Claverhouse's troopers (though, as I have said, not commanded by
Claverhouse himself) came upon the Cameronians in a desolate spot among the wilds of Ayrshire,
known as Aird's Moss. Richard Cameron was killed at the first charge: Donald Cargill and Hackston
of Rathillet were made prisoners. Both were taken to Edinburgh and executed, the latter with
circumstances of needless barbarity.

Though Claverhouse was reinstated in his commission, he does not appear to have been actively
employed during the year 1681, the second year of the Duke of York's administration in Scotland,
and the year also of the Test and Succession Acts, which were destined to cost another Argyle
his head. Early in 1682 the Duke of York returned to England, to which fact Wodrow attributes
"a sort of respite of severities," notwithstanding that Claverhouse was once more commissioned
for his old work in the West, and with even ampler authority than before. In addition to his
military powers, he was appointed Sheriff of Wigtownshire and Deputy-Sheriff of Dumfriesshire
and the Stewartries of Kirkcudbright and Annandale; and he was also specially invested with
a commission to hold criminal courts in the first-named shire and to try delinquents by jury.
His letters to Queensberry[36] begin in February 1682, and from this time onward his actions
become easier to follow. These letters give a very full and fair idea of his method of procedure,
and in one of them is a passage worth quoting as evidence how far that method as yet deserved
the hard epithets which have been so freely lavished on it. The despatch is dated from Newton
in Galloway, March 1st, 1682.

     "The proposal I wrote to your Lordship of, for securing the
     peace, I am sure will please in all things but one,--that it
     will be somewhat out of the King's pocket. The way that I
     see taken in other places is to put laws severely, against
     great and small, in execution; which is very just; but what
     effects does that produce, but more to exasperate and
     alienate the hearts of the whole body of the people; for it
     renders three desperate where it gains one; and your
     Lordship knows that in the greatest crimes it is thought
     wisest to pardon the multitude and punish the ringleaders,
     where the number of the guilty is great, as in this case of
     whole countries. Wherefore, I have taken another course
     here. I have called two or three parishes together at one
     Church, and, after intimating to them the power I have, I
     read them a libel narrating all the Acts of Parliament
     against the fanatics; whereby I made them sensible how much
     they were in the King's reverence, and assured them he was
     relenting nothing of his former severity against dissenters,
     nor care of maintaining the established government; as they
     might see by his doubling the fines in the late Act of
     Parliament; and in the end told them, that the King had no
     design to ruin any of his subjects he could reclaim, nor I
     to enrich myself by their crimes; and therefore any who
     would resolve to conform, and live regularly, might expect
     favour; excepting only resetters and ringleaders. Upon this,
     on Sunday last, there was about three hundred people at
     Kirkcudbright Church; some that for seven years before had
     never been there. So that I do expect that within a short
     time I could bring two parts of three to the Church. But
     when I have done,--that is all to no purpose. For we will be
     no sooner gone, but in comes their Ministers, and all repent
     and fall back to their old ways. So that it is vain to think
     of any settlement here, without a constant force placed in
     garrison. And this is the opinion of all the honest men
     here, and their desire. For there are some of them, do what
     they like, they cannot keep the preacher from their houses
     in their absence, so mad are some of their wives."

His remedy was to raise a hundred dragoons for a permanent garrison: the Crown was to pay the
soldiers, and the country would find maintenance for the horses, he bearing his own part as
"a Galloway laird," which he was as trustee of Macdowall's estate. The command of this new
force he was willing to undertake without any additional pay.

It does not seem that this remedy was ever sanctioned; but at any rate Claverhouse so managed
matters that a month later he was able to report to the Council that all was "in perfect peace."

     "All who were in the rebellion are either seized, gone out
     of the country, or treating their peace; and they have
     already so conformed, as to going to the Church, that it is
     beyond my expectation. In Dumfries not only almost all the
     men are come, but the women have given obedience; and
     Irongray, Welsh's own parish, have for the most part
     conformed; and so it is all over the country. So that, if I
     be suffered to stay any time here, I do expect to see this
     the best settled part of the Kingdom on this side the Tay.
     And if these dragoons were fixed which I wrote your Lordship
     about, I might promise for the continuance of it.... All
     this is done without having received a farthing money,
     either in Nithsdale, Annandale, or Kirkcudbright; or
     imprisoned anybody. But, in end, there will be need to make
     examples of the stubborn that will not comply. Nor will
     there be any danger in this after we have gained the great
     body of the people; to whom I am become acceptable enough;
     having passed all bygones, upon bonds of regular carriage
     hereafter."[37]

For these services Claverhouse was summoned to Edinburgh to receive the thanks of the Council,
to whom he presented an official report of his proceedings which is no more than a summary
of his letters to Queensberry.[38]

It was not likely that a man so uniformly successful and of such high spirit would be able
to steer clear of all offence to men, who probably felt towards him much as Elizabeth's old
courtiers felt towards the triumphant and masterful Raleigh. Nor, conscious of his own powers
and confident in the royal favour, is it probable that he was always at much pains to avoid
offence, for, though neither a quarrelsome nor a wilful man, he had his own opinions, and was
not shy of expressing them when he saw fit to do so. With all his constitutional regard for
authority and his soldier's respect for discipline, Claverhouse would suffer himself to be
browbeaten by no one. In those jealous intriguing days a man who could not fight for his own
hand was bound to go down in the struggle. Claverhouse was now to give a signal proof that
he both could and would fight for his when the need came.

The Dalrymples of Stair had been settled in Galloway for many generations. Sir James, the head
of the house, was one of the first lawyers of the day, and had held the Chair of Philosophy
in the University of Glasgow: the son, Sir John (afterwards to earn an undying name in history
as prime mover in the Massacre of Glencoe), was heritable Baillie in the regality of Glenluce.
There had been bad blood between them and Claverhouse for some time past. The father had not
profited sufficiently by his studies either in law or philosophy to recognise the folly of
a man in disgrace venturing to measure swords with one of fortune's favourites. And Sir James
at the time of his quarrel with Claverhouse was in disgrace. At the close of 1681 he had been
dismissed from the office of President of the Court of Session for refusing the Test Act; and
for some while previously he had been coldly regarded for his advocacy of gentler measures
than suited Lauderdale and his creatures. The Dalrymples were strict Presbyterians; and though
the men were too cautious to meddle openly with treasonable matters, their womenfolk were notoriously
in active sympathy with the rebels. All through Claverhouse's letters of this time run allusions
to some great personage whom it might be wise to make an example of, and he himself had taken
an early opportunity of impressing on Sir James the necessity of caution.[39] But the latter
would not be warned. He set himself against Claverhouse at every opportunity, both openly and
in secret. He wrote long querulous letters to Edinburgh, complaining of the latter's disrespect.
Finally, when he found it prudent to leave the country for a while, his son carried the business
to a height by bringing a formal charge against Claverhouse of extortion and malversation.
The latter saw his opportunity, and at once carried the war into the enemy's country. He preferred
a specific bill of complaint against Sir John, in the course of which it came out that he had
been offered a bribe both by father and son not to interfere with their hereditary jurisdictions;
and, notwithstanding the exertions of Sir George Lockhart and Fountainhall, the most eminent
counsel of the Scottish bar, utterly defeated him on every point. The Court found that Sir
John Dalrymple had been guilty of employing rebels and of winking at treasonable practices:
of not exacting the proper fines by law ordained for such misdemeanours: of stirring up the
country-folk against the King's troops; and, finally, of grossly misrepresenting Claverhouse
to the Council. For these offences he was sentenced to pay a fine of five hundred pounds and
the whole costs of the proceedings, and to be imprisoned in the Castle of Edinburgh till the
money should be paid. Claverhouse, on his side, received not only a full and most complimentary
acquittal from all his adversary's charges, but also a signal proof of the royal favour in
the presentation to a regiment of cavalry raised especially for this purpose. His commission
was dated December 25th, 1682, and in the following March he was sent into England with despatches
from the Council to the King and the Duke of York, who was still nominally Commissioner for
Scottish Affairs.[40]

Hitherto Claverhouse may be said to have stood conspicuous among the men of his time for his
persistent refusal to enrich himself at the public cost. He had certainly had many opportunities,
as had a still more famous captain after him, of wondering at his own moderation, yet his enemies
had been unable to bring home to him a single instance of malpractice. But we have now come
to an episode in his life for which an extremely virtuous or an extremely censorious moralist
might, were he so minded, find occasion to re-echo the popular epithet of rapacious. Claverhouse
was in no sense of the word an avaricious man; but, like all sensible men, he had a strong
belief in the truth of the maxim, the labourer is worthy of his hire. He had laboured long
and successfully; and the time, he thought, had now come for his hire.

Lauderdale was dying, and from every side the vultures were flocking fast to their prey. In
those days politicians looked for promotion mainly to the death or disgrace of their comrades,
and the death of any powerful statesman generally meant the disgrace of his family. All parties
were now busy in anticipation over the rich booty that was so soon to come into the market.
His brother and heir, Charles Maitland of Hatton, was attacked before the breath was out of
the old man's body. Among the many lucrative posts he enjoyed, the most lucrative was that
of Governor (or General, as the style went) of the Scottish Mint. At the instigation of Sir
George Gordon of Haddo, who had become in quick succession President of the Court of Session,
Lord Chancellor, and Earl of Aberdeen, a Commission was appointed to inquire into the state
of the coinage, with the result that Maitland (by this time Earl of Lauderdale, for the dukedom
began and ended with his brother) was declared to have appropriated to his own use no less
than seventy thousand pounds of the revenue. In the general division of spoil which this verdict
gave signal for, Claverhouse saw no reason why he should go empty away. Eleven years previously,
when the old statesman was at the height of his evil power, his brother had been appointed
Constable of Dundee and presented with the estate of Dudhope, lying conveniently near to Claverhouse's
few paternal acres. A bargain, which would have seemed in those days no disgraceful thing to
any human being, was accordingly struck between Claverhouse and the various claimants for the
dead man's shoes. Queensberry, though but lately advanced to a marquisate, had set his heart
upon a dukedom: the Chancellor was in want of money to support his new honours. And there were
other petitioners for the good offices of the ambassador to Whitehall: Huntly and the Earl
Marischal and Sir George Mackenzie had each marked his share of the general prize. To one and
all Claverhouse promised his services; and they on their part were to advance by all means
in their power his designs on the fat acres of Dudhope. All this, no doubt, sounds very contemptible
to us now, who manage these matters so much more circumspectly; but it must be remembered that
Lauderdale, though his offence was probably greatly exaggerated, and though a large part of
the fine in which he had been originally cast was in fact remitted, had certainly been guilty
of gross carelessness, if not of actual malversation; while Claverhouse on his pact offered
to pay, and did pay, whatever sum might be legally fixed as due for his share of the booty.[41]

All these bargains were in time brought to a successful issue. Claverhouse was in England from
the beginning of March to the middle of May. He was with the Court at Newmarket, Windsor, and
London, always in high favour, but at the former place finding the King more eager for his
company at the cockpit and race-course than in the council-chamber.[42] Early in May he returned
to Scotland, and shortly after his return he took his seat at Edinburgh as a Privy Councillor.
This was his present reward: Dudhope and the Constabulary were to follow later, with Queensberry's
and Huntly's dukedoms and the other honours. But Dudhope was not destined to drop into his
lap. The Chancellor, whom he counted as his particular friend, had played him false. Lauderdale's
fine had been reduced by Charles from seventy thousand pounds to twenty thousand, sixteen thousand
of which were granted to the Chancellor and four thousand to Claverhouse. But should Lauderdale
and his son agree to assign to the Chancellor under an unburdened title the lands and lordship
of Dundee and Dudhope, then the whole sum was to be remitted, Lauderdale binding himself to
discharge the fines inflicted on his subordinates. Power was also given to Claverhouse to redeem
this property from the Chancellor at twenty years' purchase; and it seems also to have been
privately agreed between them that the purchase-money was not to be exacted, on condition of
the former buying certain other lands in the neighbourhood that the latter wished to dispose
of. But the crafty Chancellor saw an easier and quieter way to get hold of his money. For the
sum of eight thousand pounds he privately relinquished all his rights to Lauderdale, thus leaving
the latter free to deal with Claverhouse on his own terms. This bit of sharp practice was effected
in August 1683; and it was not till the following March that the business was finally settled,
after a long and tedious wrangle before the Court, in the course of which Claverhouse seemed
to have found occasion to speak his mind pretty sharply to the Chancellor. On the question
of the former's right to demand Dudhope on the terms of twenty years' purchase Lauderdale had
to give way; but on the other question of clearing the title he was so difficult to deal with
that the King himself had to interfere; and not till a peremptory order had gone down from
Whitehall, cancelling the royal pardon till all the terms of the original agreement had been
satisfactorily settled, was the affair finally closed, the title cleared, and Claverhouse established
as master of the long-coveted estate.

It was not till the autumn of 1684 that Claverhouse found himself master of Dudhope and Constable
of Dundee. Meanwhile one of the few domestic events of his life that have come down to us had
taken place. On June 10th he had been married to the Lady Jean Cochrane, granddaughter to the
old Earl of Dundonald.

This young lady was the daughter of William, Lord Cochrane, by Catherine, daughter of the Presbyterian
Earl of Cassilis and sister to that Lady Margaret Kennedy whom Gilbert Burnet had married.
Her father had died before Claverhouse came on the scene, leaving seven children, of whom Jean
was the youngest. Her mother, whose notoriously Whiggish sympathies had brought both her husband
and father-in-law into suspicion, was furiously opposed to the match; though worldly prudence
may have touched her heart as well as religious scruple, for Claverhouse, though he had risen
fast and was marked by all men as destined to rise still higher, was hardly as yet perhaps
a very eligible husband for the pretty Lady Jean. But in truth it was a strange family for
him to seek a wife in, and many were the whispered gibes the news of his courtship provoked
at Edinburgh. Was this strong Samson, men asked, to fall a prey at last to a Whiggish Delilah?
Hamilton, whose own loyalty was by no means unimpeachable, and who was no friend to Claverhouse,
affected to be much distressed by the Lady Susannah's partiality for the young Lord Cochrane,
and made great parade of his disinclination to give his daughter to the son of such a mother
without the express consent of the King; and this Claverhouse chose to take as a hit at him,
who had not thought it necessary to ask any one's permission to choose his own wife. Affairs
were still further complicated by the backslidings of Sir John Cochrane, Lady Jean's uncle,
a notorious rebel who was then in hiding for his complicity with Russell and Sidney, and was
even suspected of knowing something of that darker affair of the Rye House. Claverhouse was
furious at the gossip. "My Lord Duke Hamilton," he wrote to Queensberry,

     "has refused to treat of giving his daughter to my Lord
     Cochrane, till he should have the King and the Duke's leave.
     This, I understand, has been advised him, to load me.
     Wherefore I have written to the Duke, and told him that I
     would have done it sooner, had I not judged it presumption
     in me to trouble his Highness with my little concerns; and
     that I looked upon myself as a cleanser, that may cure
     others by coming amongst them, but cannot be infected by any
     plague of Presbytery; besides, that I saw nothing singular
     in my Lord Dundonald's case, save that he has but one rebel
     on his land for ten that the lords and lairds of the south
     and west have on theirs; and that he is willing to depone
     that he knew not of there being such. The Duke is juster
     than to charge my Lord Dundonald with Sir John's crimes. He
     is a madman, and let him perish; they deserve to be damned
     that own him. The Duke knows what it is to have sons and
     nephews that follow not advice. I have taken pains to know
     the state of the country's guilt as to reset; and if I make
     it not appear that my Lord Dundonald is one of the clearest
     of all that country, and can hardly be reached in law, I am
     content to pay his fine. I never pleaded for any, nor shall
     I hereafter. But I must say I think it hard that no regard
     is had to a man in so favourable circumstances--I mean
     considering others--upon my account, and that nobody offered
     to meddle with him till they heard I was likely to be
     concerned in him.... Whatever come of this, let not my
     enemies misrepresent me. They may abuse the Duke for a time,
     and hardly. But, or long, I will, in despite of them, let
     the world see that it is not in the power of love, nor any
     other folly, to alter my loyalty."

And again on the same day:

     "For my own part, I look upon myself as a cleanser. I may
     cure people guilty of that plague of Presbytery by
     conversing with them, but cannot be infected. And I see very
     little of that amongst those persons but may be easily
     rubbed off. And for the young lady herself, I shall answer
     for her. Had she not been right principled, she would never,
     in despite of her mother and relations, made choice of a
     persecutor, as they call me."[43]

The young lady seems to have been well-favoured, though it is not easy to learn much from the
female portraits of those days, which are all very much of a piece. What else she may have
been it is impossible to say. She is a name in her husband's history and nothing more, and
in the few stormy years that were yet to run for him she could not well have been much more.
However, she seems to have been well pleased with her handsome lover; and, in spite of her
mother's opposition, the marriage was pushed briskly forward. The contract was signed at Paisley
on June 10th, and on the following day the marriage was celebrated at the same place. Lady
Catherine's is not among the signatures; but there is to be seen the almost illegible scrawl
of the old grandfather and of Euphrame his wife, a daughter of Sir William Scott of Ardross.
The bride's eldest brother, whose own marriage with the Lady Susannah Hamilton was soon to
follow, and her cousin John, son of the outlaw of Ochiltree, were also among the witnesses;
and for the bridegroom, his brother-in-arms Lord Ross[44] and Colin Mackenzie, brother of the
Lord Advocate, Sir George of Rosehaugh. The lady's jointure was fixed at five thousand merks
Scots (something over two hundred and seventy pounds of English money), secured on certain
property in Forfarshire and Perthshire; while she on her side brought her husband what in those
days was reckoned a very comfortable fortune for a younger child.[45]

The marriage was made under an evil star. Hardly had the blessing been spoken when word came
down in haste from Glasgow that the Whigs were up. Since the Sanquhar Declaration and the deaths
of Cameron and Cargill, the Covenanters had been comparatively quiet. The work of pacification
had indeed not slackened, but rather taken a fresh departure in the appointment of a Court
of High Commission, or Justiciary Circuit, which in the summer of 1683 was held in the towns
of Stirling, Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Jedburgh, and Edinburgh. Claverhouse was expressly ordered
to attend the justices in their progress as captain of the forces, except at places where the
Commander-in-Chief would naturally be present. But though the discovery of the Rye House Plot
had just then stirred the kingdom to its centre, and given fresh energies both to the Government
and its enemies, only three men suffered during this circuit, of whom two were convicted murderers.
In each town members of the gentry as well as of the common people flocked to take the Test;
some to clear themselves of suspicion, others only to air their loyalty, but all, in the words
of the report, cheerfully. Where time, moreover, was asked for consideration, it was granted
on good security. But from the end of July, 1683, to the day of his marriage, Claverhouse seems
to have been occupied almost entirely with his duties as Councillor at Edinburgh, and only
to have left the capital for brief tours of inspection through the western garrisons.

But with the day of his marriage came a change. On the previous Sunday news had been brought
to Glasgow of an unusually large and well-armed conventicle to be held at Blacklock, a moor
on the borders of Lanarkshire and Stirlingshire. Dalziel (who was in church when the message
came, but who did not suffer his duty towards God to interfere with his duty towards man) put
the soldiers on the track at once; but for the next eight-and-forty hours the country from
Hamilton northwards to the ford of Clyde was scoured in vain. The Covenanters marched fast,
and the country folk, many of them probably still fresh from the Test, kept their secret well.
Claverhouse was sent for in haste from Paisley. He was in the saddle and away before the bridal
party could recover from their first shock of surprise. But even Claverhouse was foiled. His
lieutenant, however, had better luck. Colonel Buchan, as he was returning to Paisley by way
of Lismahago, came upon an ambuscade of two hundred Covenanters, whose advanced post fired
on and wounded one of the soldiers.[46] "They followed the rogues," wrote Claverhouse to Queensberry,
"and advertised Colonel Buchan; but before he could come up, our party had lost sight of them.
Colonel Buchan is yet in pursuit and I am just taking horse. I shall be revenged some time
or other of this unseasonable trouble these dogs give me. They might have let Tuesday pass."
This despatch was written from Paisley on the morning of the 13th, while fresh horses were
being saddled. By noon he was off again, and for the next three days rode fast and far, leaving
"no den, no knowl, no moss, no hill unsearched." He could track his game from Aird's Moss to
within two miles of Cumnock town, and thence on towards Cairntable. But there all traces of
them had vanished.

     "We could never hear more of them. I sent on Friday night
     for my troop from Dumfries, and ordered them to march by the
     Sanquhar to the Muirkirk, to the Ploughlands, and so to
     Streven. I sent for Captain Strachan's troop from the
     Glenkens, and ordered him to march to the old castle of
     Cumloch, down to the Sorne, and through the country to
     Kilbryde, leaving Mauchline and Newmills on his left, and
     Loudon-hill on his right. By this means they scoured this
     country, and secured the passages that way. Colonel Buchan
     marched with the foot and the dragoons some miles on the
     right of my troop, and I, with the Guards and my Lord Ross
     and his troop, up by the [Shaire?]. We were at the head of
     Douglas. We were round and over Cairntable. We were at
     Greenock-head, Cummer-head, and through all the moors,
     mosses, hills, glens, woods; and spread in small parties,
     and ranged as if we had been at hunting, and down to
     Blackwood, but could learn nothing of those rogues. So the
     troops being extremely harassed with marching so much on
     grounds never trod on before, I have sent them with Colonel
     Buchan to rest at Dalmellington, till we see where these
     rogues will start up. We examined all on oath, and offered
     money, and threatened terribly, for intelligence, but we
     could learn no more."[47]

The "rogues" were to start up soon and with a vengeance. On a day in July (the date is not
specified) a party of troopers were escorting sixteen prisoners to Dumfries. They were Claverhouse's
men, but their captain was not with them. At Enterkin Hill, a narrow pass with a deep precipice
on either side, a rescue was attempted by a considerable body of men,--English Borderers, it
was whispered. Some of the prisoners escaped: others were killed in the scuffle or broke their
necks over the precipice: only two were brought into Edinburgh: a few of the soldiers were
also killed. This audacious affair spurred the Government on to new energies. The garrisons
were increased through all the western shires. Claverhouse, with Buchan for his second in command,
was put in charge of all the forces in Ayrshire and Clydesdale, and a special civil commission
was added to their military powers.

At length, towards the end of August, there was a lull, and the master of Dudhope was able
at last to enjoy the society of his bride and the pleasures of a country life. But of the latter
he soon grew weary. "Though I stay a few days here," he wrote to Queensberry on August 25th,
"I hope none will reproach me of eating the bread of idleness." That, at least, is a reproach
his worst enemies have never tried to fasten on him. To be doing something was, indeed, a necessity
of his existence; and his duties as Constable soon furnished him with something to do. In the
Tolbooth of Dundee lay a number of poor wretches whom the hard laws of the time had sentenced
to death for various offences, the gravest of which did not rise above theft. It was within
the Constable's power to order them at any moment for execution; and doubtless some of those
who have meddled with his life, had they been aware of this circumstance in it, would have
risked the conclusion that he did so. Yet, strange as it may seem, he exerted himself to save
the prisoners. And he exerted himself so successfully that not only was the capital sentence
reprieved to such milder punishment as he might order, but the same license was granted to
him for dealing with all future criminals of the same class.[48]

of the latter is the one known as the Leven portrait, now in possession of Lady Elizabeth Cartwright.
The portrait of Lady Jean is from a picture then belonging to the editor. There is also an
engraving of a mourning ring belonging to the editor's grandmother, Catherine Cochrane, wife
of David Smythe of Methven, said to have been given to her by her father, Lady Dundee's brother.
The ring contains a lock of Dundee's hair, on which the letters V.D. are worked in gold, with
a Viscount's coronet above. The motto is "Great Dundee for God and me. J. Rex." One child was
born of the marriage in April 1689, and he died three months after his father fell at Killiecrankie.
Lady Dundee married secondly William Livingstone, afterwards Lord Kilsyth, of whom mention
will be made elsewhere. A son was born also of this marriage, but in the autumn of 1695 both
mother and child were killed by the fall of a house in Holland. Lord Kilsyth was "out in the
Fifteen," and died an outlaw at Rome in 1733, after which the title became extinct. Napier
(iii., Appendix 2) gives a curious account of the opening of Lady Dundee's coffin more than
a hundred years after her burial in the family vault at Kilsyth Church.

by the Greenock-head, he met a man that lives down on Clydeside, that was up buying wool, who
told him that on Lidburn, which is in the heart of the hills on the Clydesdale side, he had
seen a great number of rebels in arms, and told how he had considered the commanders of them.
One of them, he said, was a lusty black man with one eye, and the other was a good-like man,
and wore a grey hat. The first had on a velvet cap. But before he (Colonel Buchan) could come
near the place, a party of foot, that he had sent to march on his right, fell accidentally
on them. Four of our soldiers going before to discover, were fired on by seven that started
up out of a glen, and one of ours was wounded. They fired at the rebels, who, seeing our party
of foot making up, and the horse in sight, took the alarm, and gained the hills, which was
all moss." Claverhouse to the Archbishop of Saint Andrews (Alexander Burnet), Paisley, June

CHAPTER VII.[49]

I propose now to examine, with more care than there has yet been occasion for, those charges
of wanton and illegal cruelty which have for close upon two centuries formed the basis of the
popular--I had almost written the historical--conception of the character of Claverhouse. I
have used the words "illegal cruelty" because Claverhouse is not only commonly believed to
have far surpassed all his contemporaries in his treatment of the Scottish Covenanters, but
to have even gone beyond the sanction of a law little disposed to be illiberal in such matters.
Some reason has, I trust, been already shown for at least reconsidering the popular verdict.
But as we are now approaching that period of his life when, for a time all too short for his
own reputation, Claverhouse at last found free play for those eminent abilities which none
have denied him, it will be well, before passing into this larger field, to be finally rid
of a most tiresome and distasteful duty. The controversial element is, I fear, inseparable
from this part of the subject, but I shall endeavour to do with as little of it as possible.

Although the significant title of "the Killing Time" seems to have been occasionally used in
Scotland during the subsequent century to cover the whole period from Lauderdale's administration
to the Revolution, yet the phrase was originally and more properly applied to the years of
James's reign alone. The most notorious of the acts attributed to Claverhouse were, as a fact,
committed within that time; but it will be more convenient not to adhere too rigidly to chronological
sequence, and to take the charges rather in order of their notoriety and of the importance
of those who have assumed them to be true. Following this order, the two first on the list
will naturally be the death, by Claverhouse's own hand, of John Brown, and the deaths, by drowning
on the sands of Solway Firth, of the two women, Margaret Maclachlan and Margaret Wilson--popularly
known as the Wigtown Martyrs.

An attempt has been made to prove that this last affair is a pure romance of Covenanting tradition.
It has never been disputed that the women were tried for high treason (that is to say, for
refusing to abjure the Covenant and to attend Episcopal worship) and condemned to death; but
it has been denied that the sentence was ever carried into effect, on the strength of a reprieve
granted by the Council at Edinburgh before the day of execution. That a reprieve, or rather
a remand, was granted is certain, as the pages of the Council register remain to this day to
testify. But it is not so certain that the decision of the Council at Edinburgh ever reached
the magistrates at Wigtown; and that, if it did reach them, they at least paid no attention
to it, remained for upwards of a century and a half the fixed opinion of all writers and readers
of history. The women were sentenced on April 18th, 1685: the remand is dated April 30th, but
the period for which it was to run has been left blank, pending the result of a recommendation
for full pardon with which it was accompanied: the sentence was executed on May 11th--in Wodrow's
words, "a black and very remarkable day for blood in several places."

It will be sufficient to indicate where the arguments employed to discredit this affair may
be found.[50] They do not practically amount to more than this--that as a reprieve was certainly
granted in the Council Chamber at Edinburgh, the execution could not possibly have taken place
on the sands of the Solway. The case is indeed one which those who will accept nothing that
cannot be proved with mathematical certainty will always find reasons for doubting; but at
least they must have read the history of those times to little purpose if they can accept such
an argument as conclusive. For the rest, it will be enough to say that the story first found
its way into print in 1687, and that it was more circumstantially repeated in 1711, when the
records of the Kirk Session of the parish of Penninghame were published by direction of the
General Assembly. At that time Thomas Wilson, a brother of the younger sufferer, was still
alive, with many others to whom the Killing-Time was something very much more than a tradition.
In 1714 (possibly to a later date, but certainly in that year) a stone in Penninghame churchyard
still marked the grave of Margaret Wilson, and told the story of her death.[51] The ruins of
the church may still be seen, but the stone has long ago gone to join the dust that was once
the bones of Margaret; and an obelisk, raised within our own times on the high ground outside
the busy little seaport, now serves in statelier, if less vital, fashion to recall to the traveller
the memory of the Martyrs of Wigtown. It is difficult to believe that a story so well and widely
recorded, and so firmly implanted in the hearts of so many generations of men, can have absolutely
no foundation in fact.[52] It is indeed possible that time has embellished the bald brutality
of the deed, though the graphic narrative of Macaulay is practically that which Wodrow took
from the records of Penninghame. But that the two women were drowned in the waters of the Blednock
on May 11th, 1685, is surely a fact as well authenticated as any in the martyrology of the
Scottish Covenant.

There is, as I have said, an excellent reason for not dragging my readers through the obscure
and barren mazes of this controversy; and like all good reasons it is a very simple one. Claverhouse
was present neither at the trial nor the execution. He had, indeed, no more to do with the
deaths of these two women than Cameron, who had been five years in his grave, or Wodrow, who
was but five years old. It is true that one of his family was present, but this was his brother,
David Graham, Deputy Sheriff of Galloway, and but lately made one of the Lords Justices of
Wigtownshire. Macaulay does not directly name Claverhouse as concerned in this affair; but
it is one out of five selected by the historian as samples of the crimes by which "he, and
men like him, goaded the Western peasantry into madness"--a consummation which, it may be observed
in passing, had been effected twelve years before Claverhouse had drawn sword in Scotland.
It is not certain that Macaulay believed the Graham who sat in judgment on these women to have
been John Graham of Claverhouse. But it is certain that the effect of his narrative has been,
in the minds of most English-speaking men, to add this also to the long list of mythical crimes
which have blackened the memory of the hero of Killiecrankie.[53]

But over the other affair there rests no shadow of doubt. That Claverhouse, and he alone, is
responsible for the death of John Brown stands on the very best authority, for it stands on
his own. It is not, indeed, certain that he shot the man with his own hand. This is Wodrow's
story, and as usual he gives no authority for it. "With some difficulty," he writes,

     "he was allowed to pray, which he did with the greatest
     liberty and melting, and withal in such suitable and
     scriptural expressions, and in a peculiar judicious style,
     he having great measures of the gift as well as the grace of
     prayer, that the soldiers were affected and astonished; yea,
     which is yet more singular, such convictions were left in
     their bosoms that, as my informations bear, not one of them
     would shoot him or obey Claverhouse's commands, so that he
     was forced to turn executioner himself, and in a fret shot
     him with his own hand, before his own door, his wife with a
     young infant standing by, and she very near the time of her
     delivery of another child. When tears and entreaties could
     not prevail, and Claverhouse had shot him dead, I am
     credibly informed the widow said to him, 'Well, sir, you
     must give an account of what you have done.' Claverhouse
     answered, 'To men I can be answerable, and as for God, I'll
     take him into my own hand.' I am well informed that
     Claverhouse himself frequently acknowledged afterwards that
     John Brown's prayer left such impressions upon his spirit
     that he could never get altogether worn off, when he gave
     himself liberty to think of it."[54]

Patrick Walker, the pedlar, writing a very few years after Wodrow (whom he notices only to
abuse for his inaccuracy and backsliding), and professing to have got his version from the
wife, tells a different tale. "Claverhouse," he says, "ordered six soldiers to shoot him. The
most part of the bullets came upon his head, which scattered his brains upon the ground." Of
any refusal, or even disinclination, on the part of the soldiers to obey their orders there
is not a word. Then we have Claverhouse's own report to Queensberry, written two days later
from Galston, a village between Kilmarnock and Ayr.

     "On Friday last, amongst the hills betwixt Douglas and the
     Ploughlands, we pursued two fellows a great way through the
     mosses, and in end seized them. They had no arms about them,
     and denied they had any. But being asked if they would take
     the abjuration, the eldest of the two, called John Brown,
     refused it; nor would he swear not to rise in arms against
     the King, but said he knew no king. Upon which, and there
     being found bullets and match in his house, and treasonable
     papers, I caused shoot him dead; which he suffered very
     unconcernedly. The other, a young fellow and his nephew,
     called John Brownen, offered to take the oath, but would not
     swear that he had not been at Newmills in arms, at rescuing
     of the prisoners. So I did not know what to do with him. I
     was convinced that he was guilty, but saw not how to proceed
     against him. Wherefore, after he had said his prayers, and
     carabines presented to shoot him, I offered to him that, if
     he would make an ingenuous confession, and make a discovery
     that might be of any importance for the King's service, I
     should delay putting him to death, and plead for him. Upon
     which he confessed that he was at that attack of Newmills,
     and that he had come straight to this house of his uncle's
     on Sunday morning. In the time he was making this confession
     the soldiers found out a house in the hill, under ground,
     that could hold a dozen of men, and there were swords and
     pistols in it; and this fellow declared that they belonged
     to his uncle, and that he had lurked in that place ever
     since Bothwell, where he was in arms.... He also gives
     account of those who gave any assistance to his uncle; and
     we have seized thereupon the goodman of the uppermost
     Ploughlands, and another tenant about a mile below that is
     fled upon it.... I have acquitted myself when I have told
     your Grace the case. He has been but a month or two with his
     halbert; and if your Grace thinks he deserves no mercy,
     justice will pass on him; for I, having no commission of
     justiciary myself, have delivered him up to the
     Lieutenant-General, to be disposed of as he pleases."[55]

It is singular that neither Wodrow nor Walker makes any mention of this nephew, whose presence
on that day, taken in connection with his share in the affair at Newmills,[56] puts the uncle
in rather a different light. There happen also to be one or two affairs known about this John
Brown which are worth noting. For instance, his name is found on a list of proscribed rebels
and resetters of rebels, appended to a royal proclamation of May 5th, 1684, which will naturally
account for his "having been a long time upon his hiding in the hills," as Wodrow ingenuously
confesses. In other words, this Brown was an outlaw and a marked man. He was by profession
a carrier--"the Christian carrier," his friends called him, for the fervour and eloquence of
his preaching, which was remarkable even in a neighbourhood where the gift of tongues was not
uncommon. A carrier is an extremely useful channel of communication; and, in fact, there can
be really no doubt that Brown had been for some time engaged in practices which the most iniquitous
Government in the world could hardly be blamed for thinking inconvenient. It has been suggested
that Claverhouse was at that time especially on the watch to intercept all communication between
Argyle and Monmouth, and that Brown was employed in carrying intelligence between the rebel
camps. Macaulay refuses this suggestion. He points out with perfect truth that both Argyle
and Monmouth were at that time in Holland. But when he goes on to say that there was no insurrection
in any part of our island, he goes rather too far. The western shires of Scotland had been
in a state of insurrection ever since the Pentland rising, if there be any meaning in the word
at all. And, though it is true that on May 1st (the day of Brown's death) Argyle was in Holland,
it is no less true that on the second he had left Holland for Scotland; that since April 21st
the Privy Council had been well informed of his designs; that measures had been taken for putting
the whole kingdom in a state of defence against him; and that arrests had been already made
on account of treasonable correspondence with him.[57] But the question is not one of probabilities,
and moreover against these probabilities it may be very fairly urged that Claverhouse's own
despatch proves that the nephew's confession and the discovery of the underground armoury were
not made till after the uncle's death. Nor is there any word in this despatch to show that
Claverhouse had any previous knowledge of Brown or was acting on particular information. The
real question, and the only question, is, was Claverhouse legally--not morally, that belongs
to another part of the case--was he legally justified in ordering the man to be shot? To this
there can be but one answer, so long as the phrase "legal justification" bears the meaning
it has hitherto borne for those who use the English tongue: both by the spirit and the letter
of his commission he was justified in what he did. By the law of the Government whose servant
Claverhouse then was, the death of John Brown on that Ayrshire moor was as lawful an act as
the death on the scaffold of any prisoner to-day found guilty by a jury of his countrymen.
In October, 1684, the Covenanters had published a declaration, drawn up by Renwick, of their
intention to do unto all their enemies whom they could lay hands on, civil no less than military,
as their enemies had done and should do unto them; and the deliberate murder of two troopers
of the Life Guards in the following month had shown (what, to be sure, can have needed very
little proof) that this was no idle threat.[58] An Act, therefore, was hastily passed to the
effect that, "Any person who owns or will not disown the late treasonable declaration on oath,
whether they have arms or not, be immediately put to death, this being always done in the presence
of two witnesses, and the person or persons having commission to that effect." With the severity,
the folly, or the injustice of such a law we are not for the moment concerned. The fact remains
that such was the law; and Claverhouse transgressed no jot of it in ordering John Brown to
death. It was no question of form of religion: it was no question of previous misconduct. The
man would not take the oath; and he was accordingly shot in the presence of the requisite number
of witnesses by the order of a competent authority.

On the truth of the details given both by Wodrow and Walker it is impossible to form any conclusion.
Wodrow gives no authority for his version. "I am well informed," he says, "I am credibly informed,"
and so on; but the sources of his information he nowhere gives. Walker is more communicative;
he, as we have seen, professed to have learned his story from Brown's wife; but no statement
of Walker's can be accepted for absolute truth, and his uncertainty about even the names of
his witnesses does not add the stamp of conviction to their testimony.[59] Beyond the bare
fact that the man was shot in the presence of Claverhouse nothing is certain. On the rest of
the story each must make up his mind as seems best to him.

With the death of Peter Gillies and John Bryce Claverhouse is not directly charged by Wodrow.
Walker, however, quotes an epitaph said to have been inscribed on the grave of these men, who,
with three others, were hanged, without trial, at Mauchline by

    "Bloody Dumbarton, Douglas, and Dundee,
    Moved by the devil and the Laird of Lee."

These lines must have been composed some years after the event, inasmuch as the men were hanged
on May 6th, 1685, and the patent of Claverhouse's peerage bears the date November 12th, 1688.
This proves, what indeed few people can have doubted, that the damning testimony of "The Cloud
of Witnesses" wants at least the weight of contemporary evidence. An authority, however, for
this particular epitaph can be traced back to 1690, when Alexander Shields published his martyrology.[60]
"The said Claverhouse," he wrote, "together with the Earl of Dumbarton and Lieut.-General Douglas,
caused Peter Gillies, John Bryce, Thomas Young (who was taken by the Laird of Lee), William
Fiddisone, and John Buiening to be put to death upon a gibbet, without legal trial or sentence,
suffering them neither to have a Bible nor to pray before they died."[61] Defoe has evidently
followed Shields;[62] but Walker, though he quotes the aforesaid epitaph, does not himself
implicate Claverhouse.

Wodrow does not appear to have heard any of these stories. He names only Gillies and Bryce,
quoting from the indictment, which does not specify the other sufferers, to show that the men
were tried before General Drummond and a tribunal of fifteen soldiers on May 5th, and hanged
on the following day. We have already seen that a few days previously Claverhouse had sent
a prisoner for trial to this same General Drummond, because he had himself at that time no
commission to try prisoners. Unless, therefore, we are ready to suppose that officers were
in the habit of sitting on a jury with their own troopers, or to believe that within three
days a change had taken place in Claverhouse's position of which there is no record either
in his own letters or in any other existing document, we must accept Wodrow's narrative as
the true one, and exonerate Claverhouse from all responsibility for the deaths of Gillies and
his unfortunate fellow-sufferers.

Two cases yet remain of the five cited by Macaulay. With one of these--the case of the three
men shot near Glasgow for refusing to pray for the King--no writer has ever pretended to implicate
Claverhouse personally; but with the other he is directly concerned. Andrew Hislop was the
son of a poor widow in whose house a proscribed Covenanter had lately died. This was discovered
by one Johnstone of Westerhall, an apostate Presbyterian, and, like most of his class, particularly
bitter against his former associates. He turned the woman with her younger children into the
fields, pulled down her house, and dragged the eldest son before Claverhouse, then marching
through that part of the country. So Macaulay tells the story, following for once the "Cloud
of Witnesses" rather than Wodrow. According to the latter, Claverhouse found Hislop wandering
about the fields, and carried him before Westerhall, "without any design, as appeared, to murder
him." Westerhall voted for instant death, while Claverhouse pleaded for the lad, and only yielded
at last on the other's insistence, saying: "The blood of this poor man be upon you, Westerhall.
I am free of it." He thereupon ordered the captain of a Highland company, then brigaded with
his own men, to provide a firing-party; but the Highlanders angrily refused, and the troopers
had to do the work. Both versions, it will be seen, agree in representing Claverhouse as inclined
to mercy but overborne by Westerhall. The question remains, how was it that the former, a masterful
man and not easy to be silenced when he was in the right, could not save this poor lad if he
had a mind to do so?

The answer is in truth not easy to find. The explanation that Westerhall was at that particular
time superior in authority to Claverhouse will hardly serve. It is true that the latter had
just then no civil jurisdiction at all, either to condemn or pardon--no commission of justiciary,
as he wrote to Queensberry. He had been since the close of the previous year in disgrace at
headquarters, in consequence of a quarrel between him and the Treasurer, arising out of some
action of Colonel James Douglas, the latter's brother, of which Claverhouse seems to have expressed
his disapproval rather too warmly. His name had accordingly been removed from the list of Privy
Councillors soon after James's accession, and himself deprived of all his civil powers. His
punishment did not indeed last long, nor was it allowed to affect his military rights. An order
for his restoration to the Council had been signed on the very day of Hislop's death (though
he did not take his seat again till July), but his civil powers had not been renewed. Westerhall
was one of those who had in the previous year been empowered by royal commission to try prisoners,
and his commission was still running when Claverhouse was disgraced. But on April 20th General
Drummond was appointed to the supreme authority in all the southern and western shires, and
his appointment was expressly declared to cancel all other civil commissions previously granted.
Unless, therefore, some particular reservation had been made in Westerhall's favour, of which
there is no existing record, he had no more jurisdiction than Claverhouse, and both were equally
guilty of breaking the law. It was, indeed, still open to Claverhouse to act as he had acted
with John Brown--to put the abjuration oath, and, on its being refused, to order the recusant
to instant execution. There is no mention by any of the Covenanting writers that this oath
was offered to Hislop. But unless it was, it is difficult to see how either Westerhall or Claverhouse
could have been empowered to kill him. Nor is it likely that the latter, knowing well how many
sharp eyes were on the look-out in Edinburgh to catch him tripping, would have ventured on
so flagrant a breach of the law. It must also be remembered that neither Wodrow nor Walker,
nor any writer on that side, has charged Claverhouse with exceeding the law. They cry out against
the cruelty of the deed, but on its unlawfulness they are silent. We must suppose, therefore,
that Hislop's case was the case of John Brown: he had refused the oath, and was therefore liable
to death. But we cannot suppose that if Claverhouse had stood firm he could not have saved
the lad's life. It is absurd to believe that at the head of his own soldiers, with another
captain of the same way of thinking by him, such a man as Claverhouse was not strong enough
to carry his own will against one who had not even the powers of an ordinary justice of the
peace. We must, therefore, conclude that he was unwilling at that time to run the risk of further
disgrace by any charge of unreasonable leniency to rebels. Like Pilate, he was willing to let
the prisoner go; but, like Pilate again, he preferred his own convenience, and the prisoner
was put to death.

On Defoe's list of victims murdered, as he calls it, by Claverhouse's own hand is the name
of Graham of Galloway. The young man, he says, being pursued by the dragoons, had taken refuge
in his mother's house; but being driven out thence was overtaken by Claverhouse and shot dead
with a pistol, though he offered to surrender and begged hard for his life. Shield so words
his version of the story as to make it doubtful whether the shot was fired by Claverhouse himself.
In the "Cloud of Witnesses" it is not even made certain that Claverhouse was present. At the
close of the year in which this alleged murder was committed Sir John Dalrymple brought his
action against Claverhouse. It is not likely that so shrewd a lawyer would have overlooked
such a chance as this, a case of murder committed in his own country; for murder it would certainly
have been, were Defoe's story true. In 1682 military executions had not been sanctioned by
law; and for a soldier to shoot a man offering to surrender would have been as clear a case
of murder as was the butchery on Magus Moor. Yet throughout Dalrymple's indictment is no hint
of any such offence. Claverhouse is accused of oppression by excessive fines and illegal quartering
of troops, of malversation, and so forth; but of taking man's life unlawfully there is no single
word.

Another of Defoe's victims is Matthew Mekellwrath. Claverhouse, he says, riding through Camonel
in Carrick, saw a man run across the street in front of the soldiers, as though to get out
of their way, and instantly ordered him to be shot, without any examination. In the "Cloud
of Witnesses" an epitaph is quoted to show that the man was shot for refusing the abjuration oath.

Next we find four men dragged out of a house at Auchencloy, on Dee-side, where they had met
for prayer, and shot before the door, without any examination. Defoe gives the names of the
four as John Grier, Robert Fergusson, Archibald Stuart, and Robert Stuart. Shields substitutes
for Archibald Stuart the name of James Macmichael. In "The Cloud of Witnesses" only Grier,
Robert Stuart, and Fergusson are named. In Wodrow's pages the four men become eight: of these
four, as given by Shields (Macmichael, however, being spelt Macmichan), were shot at once:
two more, Smith and Hunter, were carried to Kirkcudbright and hanged after a form of trial:
two, unnamed, got safe away. "It may be," adds Wodrow, "the rescue of some prisoners at Kirkcudbright
by some of the wanderers, a little before this, was the pretext for all this cruelty."

It may indeed have been so, and something more than a rescue of prisoners may have helped.
The affair on Dee-side took place December 18th, 1684. On the 11th of the same month (just
after Renwick's proclamation of war) a party of men, headed by James Macmichael, murdered Peter
Peirson, minister of Carsphairn, at his own door. Wodrow cannot shirk this fact: he finds it
detestable, and generally denounced and disowned by the more respectable of the Covenanters;
but he also manages to find as many excuses for it as he conveniently can in the provocation
given by the victim. Peirson, he says, was "a surly, ill-natured man, and horridly severe."
He was of great service to Lagg in ferreting out rebels, used to sit in court with him to advise
him of the prisoners' characters, and generally make himself obnoxious to the Covenanters.
He was also accused of leaning to popery, and is said on one occasion to have openly defended
the doctrine of purgatory; on another he maintained Papists to be much better subjects than
Presbyterians--as, indeed, from the Government's point of view they certainly were. How far
Peirson deserved this character we cannot surely tell. The fact of his being hated by the Covenanters
is not necessarily to his discredit; but we may assume that he was not conciliatory in his
speech, that he meddled more in civil matters than became his cloth, and, in short, was probably
made much after the same pattern as some of the chosen vessels of the Covenanting tabernacle.
He lived alone in his manse, without even a servant, but took care always to have his firearms
handy. The accounts of the murder vary a little in detail. One says that he was killed in a
scuffle arising out of his furious and unprovoked treatment of a deputation which waited on
him at midnight, to request him to come outside and speak with some friends who meant him no
harm--a request which in the circumstances he can hardly be blamed for having received with
some degree of suspicion. But the most authentic version represents him as shot dead the instant
he opened his door. Macmichael fired the shot, and the man who called Peirson out was Robert
Mitchell, nephew to James Mitchell, who was hanged five years previously for an attempt on
Sharp's life.[63]

A week later, on December 18th, a party of Covenanters more than one hundred strong burst into
Kirkcudbright ("the most irregular place in the kingdom," Claverhouse used to call it), killed
the sentry who challenged them, broke open the gaol, set all the prisoners free, and then marched
victoriously off, beating the town drum, with such of their rescues as would go with them,
and all the arms they could lay hands on.

It is clear, then, from a comparison of the dates and names, that the men killed at Auchencloy
were no innocent folk met together for prayer, but certainly included Peirson's murderer, and
probably some of those concerned in the rescue at Kirkcudbright, as the place where they were
surprised was but a few miles from that town. Moreover, it appears from another account that,
so far from these men having been shot unresistingly, they were part of a larger force which
had only been dispersed after a sharp skirmish.[64]

One more instance, and this part of my business will be done. Defoe names Robert Auchinleck
as shot by Claverhouse without examination for not answering his challenge, the man, as was
subsequently discovered, being too deaf to hear what was said to him. There is no mention elsewhere
of Robert Auchinleck; but Shields includes in his list a man called Auchinleck, of Christian
name unknown, who was killed in similar circumstances; and Wodrow gives a different version
of the death of one William Auchinleck, both assigning the act to one Captain Douglas, who
was marching from Kirkcudbright with a company of foot.[65]

These instances have been chosen as the most notorious and the most circumstantially recorded
of the indictments made against Claverhouse. Of the traditions that gathered in the following
century about his name I have taken no notice, nor of the vague charges brought by writers
of still later date on no better authority than those traditions.[66] It was inevitable that
as time wore on these floating legends would be gathered to one common head, and that the most
important figure would be selected to bear the sins of all. It is of course possible that many
and more damning instances might be added to the foregoing list, of which the record has now
perished. But the most that can be done is to take what the counsel for the prosecution have
brought forward, and to examine it as strictly as can now be possible.

It must always be difficult to reconsider with absolute impartiality any verdict that has been
generally accepted for close upon two hundred years. On the one hand, there is a not unnatural
disinclination for the trouble necessary to re-open a case already heard and judged: on the
other, is a most natural inclination to take every fresh fact discovered, or every old blunder
detected, as of paramount importance. The explorer in strange lands is too apt to take every
mole-hill for a mountain. And when the verdict is one that has been endorsed by Macaulay, he
must be a bold man indeed who thinks to upset it. Nevertheless, something has, I hope, been
done to bear out my belief that Claverhouse has been too harshly judged. No attempt has been
made to gloss over or conceal any crime that can be brought fairly home to him. The case of
Andrew Hislop (a far blacker case than the more notorious one of John Brown) has been left
as it stands, so far as the imperfect evidence enables us now to judge it. If that one case
be held enough to substantiate the general verdict, if nothing can be set against it, there
is no more to be said--save that, if this be justice, many a better man than Claverhouse must
go to the wall.

One thing, at least, should be clear. He was no capricious and unlicensed oppressor of a God-fearing
and inoffensive peasantry, but a soldier waging war against a turbulent population carrying
arms and willing to use them. I have nowhere tried to soften the bitter tale of folly, misrule,
and cruelty which drove those unhappy men into rebellion, nor to heighten by a single touch
their responsibility for their own misfortunes. I have not tried to find excuses for the men
whose orders Claverhouse obeyed, nor arguments to show that in the circumstances such orders
were inevitable. But I have tried to show that in no single instance, of which the record is
complete, did he go beyond the letter of his commission, and that in more than one instance
he construed its spirit with a mildness for which he has never yet been given credit.

But nothing will avail to save him in the eyes of those who maintain that the law of human
morality is fixed and immutable, and that men of every age and every country can only be judged,
and must be judged, by the eternal laws of right and wrong. They, of course, will not allow
the excuse that he was a soldier obeying the orders of his superior officers, even should they
be disposed to admit that he did no more than that. The orders, they will say, were cruel and
unjust: he should have refused to obey them. But is this unswerving standard possible as a
gauge of human actions? Who then shall be safe? There are offences which, in Coleridge's happy
phrase, are offences against the good manners of human nature itself. The man who committed
such offences in the reign of Chedorlaomer was no doubt as guilty as the man who should commit
them in the reign of Victoria. But are the offences which can be fairly laid to Claverhouse's
account of such a kind? His most able and his bitterest accuser pronounces him to have been
"rapacious and profane, of violent temper and obdurate heart." Yet every attempt of his enemies
to convict him of extortion or malversation broke signally down. The decorum of his life and
conversation was allowed even by the Covenanters; and it is recorded as a notable thing that,
however disturbed or thwarted, he was never known to use profane language. The imperturbable
calm of his temper is said by one of their own party to have at once exasperated and terrified
those who were brought before him far more than the brutal fury of men like Dalziel and Lag.[67]
His heart was indeed hard to those whom he regarded as plotters and murderers, traitors to
their King and enemies of the true religion. He was indeed in his own way as much a fanatic
as the men whom he was empowered to crush. His devotion to the Crown and to the Protestant
faith was a passion as deep and sincere as that which moved the simple peasants of the West
to find the gospel of Christ in the horrible compound of blasphemy and treason which too often
made up the eloquence of the Conventicles. But his hardness, if not tempered with mercy, was
at least guided by more justice than was common among his colleagues. He both advocated and
practised the policy of distinguishing between the multitude and their ringleaders. The just
punishment of one of the latter might save, he said, many of the former;[68] and his entreaty
for the prisoners whom he found under sentence of death at Dundee proves that his actions were
dictated by no vulgar thirst for blood. When judged by the general manners of the age, the
circumstances of the time and his position, I do not believe him to have been cruel by nature
or careless of human life. The standard of military morals in vogue two hundred years ago cannot
be weighed by that in vogue to-day. The humanity of one generation is not the humanity of the
next. Wellington was certainly not a cruel man, and he certainly was a most strict disciplinarian.
Yet it is well known that many things were done during the Peninsular campaign which no general
now would dare to pass unpunished, which no soldier now would even dare to do; and it is quite
possible that eighty years hence our descendants will read with horror of the deeds done by
their grandsires among the rocky passes of Afghanistan or on the burning sands of Egypt. I
do not claim for Claverhouse that he was gentle, merciful, or humane beyond his time, though
I believe him to have had as large a share of those qualities as any of his contemporaries
would have displayed in similar circumstances. But I do claim for him that his faults were
the faults not of the man but of his age; and I maintain that his age cannot in such matters
be tried by the standard of this.

FOOTNOTES:

[49] I have been much indebted in this chapter to an anonymous pamphlet entitled "A Note to
the Pictorial History of Scotland, on Claverhouse," apparently printed at Maidstone; but when,
or on whose authority, I have been unable to discover. It was sent to me by an equally nameless
benefactor.

1863. On the other side see Barton, vii. 255: Macmillan's Magazine, December 1862; and a pamphlet
by the Rev. Archibald Stewart, "History Vindicated in the case of the Wigtown Martyrs," 2nd
ed. 1869.

[51] According to "The Cloud of Witnesses," first published in 1714, the epitaph ran as follows:

    "Murdered for owning Christ supreme
    Head of his Church, and no more crime
    But her not owning Prelacy,
    And not abjuring Presbytery.
    Within the sea, tied to a stake,
    She suffered for Christ Jesus' sake."

The stone on which these lines were inscribed covered, according to the same authority, "the
body of Margaret Wilson, who was drowned in the water of the Blednock upon the 11th of May,
1684 [5], by the Laird of Lagg."

[52] In Colonel Fergusson's most entertaining chapter of family history, "The Laird of Lagg,"
he mentions an old lady, still alive in 1834, who remembered her grandfather's account of the
execution, which he declared he had himself witnessed: "There were cluds o' folk on the sands
that day in clusters here and there, praying for the women as they were put down."

whom Claverhouse and his men bound to a stake."

a house belonging to the Earl of Loudon, having taken some of these fanatics prisoners, and
though he had power to execute them, yet keeping them alive, some of their desperate comrades
breaks in upon the garrison and rescues them, to their great shame; for which Inglis was degraded,
and his place was given to Mr. George Winrahame, a bigot Papist." Fountainhall, quoted by Napier,
iii. 457. This Winrahame may be the Winram who had to do with the Wigtown Martyrs. According
to "The Cloud of Witnesses,"

    "The actors of this cruel crime
    Was Lagg, Strachan, Winram, and Grahame."

A letter more or less in a name was of no account in the cacography of those times.

[57] "The new reign was not to remain long undisturbed; before the end of April there was the
apprehension of a great civil war, and in May the news came that it had begun both in England
and Scotland." These are Burton's words (vii. 258), and no one can accuse Burton of undue partiality
to James or his government. See also Aytoun's Appendix to his "Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers,"
which, however, was written before the publication of Napier's book had proved Claverhouse's
responsibility for the death of John Brown.

[58] Wodrow, iv. 148-9. He prints the declaration in full from a copy in Renwick's own handwriting.
The following extracts will give some idea of it: "We have disowned the authority of Charles
Stuart (not authority as God's institution, either among Christians or heathens) and all authority
depending upon him, for reasons given elsewhere (disclaiming all such things as infer a magistratical
relation betwixt him and us); and also we have declared war against him, and his accomplices
such as lay out themselves to promote his wicked and hellish designs.... We do hereby declare
unto all that whosoever stretcheth forth their hands against us ... by shedding our blood actually,
either by authoritative commanding, such as bloody counsellors ... especially that so-called
justiciary, generals of forces, adjutants, captains, lieutenants, and all in civil and military
power, who make it their work to embrue their hands in our blood, or by obeying such commands,
such as bloody militia men, malicious troopers, soldiers, and dragoons; likewise such gentlemen
and commons who, through wickedness and ill-will, ride and run with the foresaid persons ...
we say all and every one of such shall be reputed by us enemies to God and the covenanted work
of reformation, and punished as such, according to our power and the degree of their offence....
Let not any think that (our God assisting us) we will be so slack-handed in time coming to
put matters in execution as heretofore we have been, seeing we are bound faithfully and valiantly
to maintain our covenants and the cause of Christ."

[59] For example, in the earliest edition of the pamphlet containing his version of this affair
("The Life of Peden") an "old singular Christian woman named Elizabeth Menzies" is mentioned
as the first neighbour who came to condole with Mrs. Brown. In later editions Elizabeth Menzies
becomes Jean Brown. The wife also is sometimes Isabel and sometimes Marion. Walker's "Biographia
Presbyteriana" is a collection of tracts published by him at different times, of which this
"Life of Peden" is the earliest and the best.

[60] "A Short Memorial of the Sufferings of the Presbyterians."

[61] This Buiening is called Bruning in "The Cloud of Witnesses," and may be the Brownen of
Claverhouse's letter, that is to say, the nephew of John Brown.

[62] "It seems somebody had maliciously told this Graham they were of the Whigs who used the
field meetings, upon which, without any trial or other sentence than his own command, his soldiers
fetched them all to Mauchline, a village where his headquarters were, and hanged them immediately,
not suffering them to enter into any house at their coming, nor at the entreaty of the poor
men would suffer one to lend them a Bible, who it seems offered it, nor allow them a moment
to pray to God." Defoe's "Memoirs of the Church of Scotland" were first published in 1717,
a few years before Wodrow's History. Elsewhere in the same work he states that Claverhouse
had "among the rest of his cruelties barbarously murdered several of the persecuted people
with his own hands," also that "this man is said to have killed above a hundred men in this
kind of cold blood cruelty." But Defoe's qualifications for a historian of those times are,
to say the least, uncertain. He mentions Cameron and Cargill as alive and busy in 1684, four
years after one had died fighting at Aird's Moss, and the other on the scaffold at Edinburgh.

[63] Wodrow, iv. 197; Napier, i. 89. I have called this the most authentic version because
it professes to have come from the murderers themselves. It is to be found in a letter to Wodrow
(printed by Napier) now in the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh. The date is 1715, and the writer,
who only signs his initials, J.C., calls Wodrow "cousin." "I give you the account," he writes,
"from the best information it's possible to be got, viz., from Robert Dun, in Woodheade of
Carsphairn, and John Clark, then in that parish, now in Glenmont, in the parish of Strathone,
anent the curate's death of Carsphairn, which they had from the actors' own mouths." Wodrow
adds a little touch of his own--"Mr. Peirson with fury came out upon them with arms"--and is
silent on the fact of Mitchell's presence.

[64] Fountainhall's "Historical Notices," and a letter to Queensberry from Sir Robert Dalzell
and others, quoted by Napier, ii. 427-8.

[65] Wodrow, iv. 184.

[66] For example, the story told of Claverhouse sparing a man's life for the sport his capture
had afforded, but ordering his ears to be shorn off. This may be found in a book called "Gleanings
among the Mountains, or Traditions of the Covenanters," published at Edinburgh, in 1846, by
the Rev. Robert Simpson, of Sanquhar. The same gentleman is responsible for an earlier volume,
"The Times of Claverhouse," in which the Covenanters are described as a class of "quiet and
orderly men," maintaining the standard of their gospel in "the most peaceful and inoffensive
way." In neither volume is any authority offered for these stories: even the evidence of time
and place is rarely vouchsafed.

[67] Walker's "Biographia Presbyteriana:" Lochiel's Memoirs.

[68] See _ante_, p. 92: also Napier, ii. 360, for a letter to the Lord Chancellor, June 9th,
1683. "I am as sorry to see a man die, even a Whig, as any of themselves. But when one dies
justly, for his own faults, and may save a hundred to fall in the like, I have no scruple."

CHAPTER VIII.

Both in Scotland and England events were now moving fast to their inevitable conclusion, but
of Claverhouse's part in public affairs there is for the next three years little record. Only
two of his letters have survived between May, 1685, and October, 1688, when the disastrous
march into England began. From one of these it is clear that his restoration to favour at Whitehall
had not improved his position at Edinburgh. Gratitude was not then a common virtue among public
men. Claverhouse had done for his colleagues all that he had promised. The recollection of
their debt to him, and the unlikelihood of their being able to increase it, did not serve to
endear to them this successful soldier of fortune, who had indeed helped them to their ambition,
but who had thereby shown a dangerous capacity for helping himself. At the head of these malcontents
was, of course, Queensberry, though, as the King had shown himself determined not to lose the
services of his brilliant captain, it was necessary for the Treasurer to give his jealousy
a guarded form. He complained to Dumbarton (then commanding the forces in Scotland) that Claverhouse
had misused some of his tenants, though in what manner is not clear. There is a letter from
Claverhouse expressing in respectful terms his regret at Queensberry's annoyance, which he
declares to have been founded on misapprehension of the facts.

     "I am convinced (he writes) your Grace is ill-informed; for,
     after you have read what I wrote to you two days ago on that
     subject, I daresay I may refer myself to your own censure.
     That I had no desire to make great search there, anybody may
     judge. I came not from Ayr till after eleven in the
     forenoon, and went to Balagen with forty heritors again
     night. The Sanquhar is just in the road; and I used these men
     I met accidentally on the road better than ever I used any
     in these circumstances. And I may safely say that, as I
     shall answer to God, if they had been living on my ground I
     could not have forborne drawing my sword and knocking them
     down. However, I am glad I have received my Lord Dumbarton's
     orders anent your Grace's tenants, which I shall most
     punctually obey; though, I may say, they were safe as any in
     Scotland before."[69]

The previous letter here referred to has been lost; but it is probable that the complaint originated
in Claverhouse's summons to these heritors, or small proprietors, to take arms in the King's
service, as they were bound to do. Men will mostly follow their master's lead. The Treasurer's
tenants knew well, we may be sure, how little love their master bore for the imperious soldier,
and were no doubt somewhat saucy in their remonstrances; and sauciness Claverhouse would not
brook from any man alive, whatever his quality.

But Queensberry and his crew had to nurse their grudge in secret. Much as the knowledge may
have chafed them, they knew well that Claverhouse was the one man on whom they could depend
for wise counsel and prompt action in emergency. A few weeks before this matter of the tenants
he had received an urgent despatch from Edinburgh, signed by "his affectionate friends and
servants" of the Council, authorising him to take what steps he thought best for disposing
the troops. Argyle was on the sea, and the Campbells were mustering fast to their chief's call.
Measures had already been taken in the northern shires. Athole had been appointed Lord-Lieutenant
of Argyleshire, and held Inverary with a large force of his Highlanders. The Gordons, under
their new-made Duke, were guarding the sea-board of Invernessshire. Glasgow was occupied by
a strong body of militia. Ships of war watched the Firth of Clyde. To keep the Western Lowlands
and the Border quiet was Claverhouse's charge. It is unnecessary to remind my readers what
followed. Within little more than a month from his landing in Scotland Argyle stood upon the
scaffold in Edinburgh; and a fortnight later Monmouth closed his short unhappy life on Tower Hill.

In this same despatch Claverhouse was told that the King had raised him to be a brigadier of
both horse and foot, that James Douglas had received the same promotion, and that the latter's
commission bore priority of date. He wisely took no notice of this slight,--for, comparing
the weight of his services to the Government with the services of Douglas, a slight it undoubtedly
was, and was meant to be. He knew that it did not come from the King, and he was much too prudent
and too proud to let the others see that he was annoyed by a stupid insult he was powerless
to resent. But there exists a letter from Secretary Murray to Queensberry which makes the business
very clear. It is worth quoting as significant of the petty intrigues in which men of rank
and position were not then ashamed to indulge.

     "The King ordered two commissions to be drawn, for your
     brother and Claverhouse to be brigadiers. We were ordered to
     see how such commissions had been [drawn?] here, and in Earl
     Middleton's office we found the extract of one granted to
     Lord Churchill, another to Colonel Worden, the one for
     horse, the other for foot. So Lord Melfort told me the King
     had ordered him to draw one for your brother for the foot
     and Claverhouse for the horse. I told him that could not be;
     for by that means Claverhouse would command your brother. To
     be short, we were very hot on the matter. He said he knew no
     reason why Colonel Douglas should have the precedency,
     unless that he was your brother. I told him that was enough,
     but that there was a greater, and that was, that he was an
     officer of more experience and conduct, and that was the
     King's design of appointing brigadiers at this time. He said
     Claverhouse had served the King longer in Scotland. I told
     him that was yet wider from the purpose, for there were in
     the army that had served many years longer than Claverhouse,
     and of higher quality, and without disparagement to any,
     gallant in their personal courage. By this time I flung from
     him, and went straight to the King and represented the case.
     He followed, and came to us. But the King changed his mind
     and ordered him to draw the commissions both for horse and
     foot, and your brother's two days' date before the other; by
     which his command is clear before the other. I saw the
     commissions signed this afternoon, and they are sent
     herewith by Lord Charles Murray. Now, I beseech Your Grace,
     say nothing of this to any; nay, not now to your brother.
     For Lord Melfort said to Sir Andrew Forrester, that he was
     sure there would be a new storm on him. I could not, nor is
     [it] fit this should have been kept from you; but you will
     find it best for a while to know or take little notice, for
     it gives him but ground of talking, and serves no other
     end."[70]

But these jealous fellows were not to have it all their own way. In the autumn of the same
year Claverhouse was summoned to London with Balcarres to be heard on a complaint he had in
his turn to make against Queensberry. Early in the spring he had been peremptorily ordered
to discharge a bond he had given to the Treasury for fines due from delinquents in Galloway.
He answered that his brother (then Deputy-Sheriff of that shire) was collecting the fines,
and requested more time for payment. On being told that he might take five or six days, he
replied that, considering the difficulty of collection and the distances to be travelled, they
might as well give him none. "Then," answered Queensberry, "you shall have none."[71] Claverhouse
had many times applied for leave to be heard in his own defence; but Murray had hitherto persuaded
the King to answer that no audience could be granted to him until he had made his peace with
the Treasurer and been restored to his seat at the Council. But the name of Queensberry was
not now the power it had been at Whitehall. It is difficult to believe that he was much more
concerned with religion than Lauderdale; but he was, at any rate by profession, a staunch Protestant,
and there were those among his colleagues ready to take every advantage of this passport to
James's disfavour. It was determined to hear what Claverhouse had to say for himself. He was
summoned to London, graciously received by the King, and pleaded his cause so effectually that
the Treasurer was ordered to refund the money.

Claverhouse and Balcarres returned to Edinburgh on December 24th. With them came the Chancellor
Perth and his brother, John Drummond, the new Lord Melfort. The brothers were in James's best
books, for they had recently professed themselves converted to the Roman Catholic faith by
the convincing logic of the papers found in Charles's strong-box and made public by the King.[72]
But they were not so popular in Edinburgh. The new year opened with something very like a No
Popery riot. Lady Perth was insulted on her way home from mass by a baker's boy. The Privy
Council ordered the lad to be whipped through the Canongate, but the 'prentices rose to the
rescue of their comrade. The guard was called out: there was firing, and some citizens fell.
There was disaffection, too, among the troops: one soldier was arrested for refusing to fire
on a Protestant: another was shot for threatening to run his sword through a Papist. In the
Council Perth moved that one Canaires, minister at Selkirk, should be arraigned for preaching
against the Pope; but he found no man on his side except Claverhouse, who, though Protestant
to the backbone, had no mind to see his King insulted under the cloak of religion. James's
famous scheme of Universal Toleration was soon found to be what every sensible man had foreseen--a
scheme of toleration for his own religion and of persecution for all others.

But the history of the next three years, with its wretched tale of violence and folly, of oppressions
that broke the hearts of the loyal, and concessions that only moved the scorn of the mutinous,
may be read elsewhere. The last appearance of Claverhouse on the scene is at the Council in
February, 1686, where he supports Perth in his motion to bring the indiscreet minister to book,
till he appears again in his proper character as a soldier commanding the cavalry of the Scottish
contingent on its march south to join the army of England. We know, however, that in that same
year, 1686, he was promoted to be Major-General, and in March, 1688, was made Provost of Dundee.
We must now pass to the memorable autumn of the latter year.

In September, 1688, a despatch in James's own hand was sent down to the Council at Edinburgh
announcing the imminent invasion of England by the Prince of Orange. Perth, still Chancellor
and a Papist, was told to do nothing without consulting Balcarres and Tarbat. Their advice
was unquestionably the best that could have been given for James and the worst for England;
for, had it been followed, instead of the short Highland campaign of the following year, that
began at Killiecrankie and ended at Dunkeld, there would in all probability have been civil
war throughout the kingdom. They advised that the regular troops under Douglas and Claverhouse,
now between three and four thousand strong, should be augmented by a force of twelve thousand
raised from the Highland clans and the militia, and that these troops should be distributed
along the Border and through the northern shires of England. Preparations were at once begun
to this effect. The chiefs of the great clans were ordered to hold their claymores ready: the
castles of Edinburgh and Stirling were munitioned for war: the militia was called out in every
county, and volunteers enrolled in every town. In the midst of the bustle arrived a second
despatch from James, ordering the regular troops to march at once for England to join the army
under Feversham. This foolish order was Melfort's doing, urged by his secretary, Stewart of
Goodtrees, who, after having been concerned in all the most notorious plots of the last twenty
years, and actually condemned to death for his share in Argyle's rebellion, had now blossomed
into an Under-Secretary of State. Remonstrance was useless. "The order," wrote Balcarres, "was
positive and short--advised by Mr. James Stewart at a supper, and wrote upon the back of a
plate, and an express immediately despatched therewith."

And so "with a sorrowful heart," he goes on to remind the exiled King, "they began their march--three
thousand effective young men--vigorous, well-disciplined and clothed, and, to a man, hearty
in your cause, and willing, out of principle as well as duty, to hazard their lives for the
support of the Government as then established both in Church and State."[73] The loyalty of
some of these fine fellows was, however, destined soon to suffer a change in the disturbing
atmosphere of England.

The full strength of the Scottish contingent was three thousand seven hundred and sixty-three
men. Douglas was in command, with Claverhouse under him at the head of the cavalry, which mustered
eight hundred and forty-one sabres, including his own regiment, Livingstone's troop of Life
Guards, and Dunmore's dragoons, a regiment which, as the Scots Greys, has since earned a reputation
second to none in the British Army. The infantry was made up of Douglas's own regiment of Foot
Guards, now the Scots Guards: Buchan's regiment, now the Twenty-first of the Line, or, to give
them their latest title, the Royal Scots Fusiliers; and Wauchope's regiment:--two thousand
nine hundred and twenty-two men in all.[74] They left Scotland in the beginning of October,
the foot marching by way of Chester, the horse by way of York, on London. Early in November
they reached the capital, where they lay for a few days: Claverhouse, with his own regiment
and the Horse Guards, being quartered in Westminster, the dragoons in Southwark, and Douglas,
with his Foot Guards, in Holborn. On the tenth of the month they marched for Salisbury, where
the King's army was now gathered. During the march Claverhouse received the last and most signal
proof of favour James was to give him. On November 12th he had been created Viscount of Dundee.

In the royal camp all was confusion and doubt. William was at Axminster, and not a single enemy
was in his rear. Many of the great English houses had already joined him, and each hour brought
news to Salisbury of fresh disaffection in every part of the kingdom. James was at first anxious
to fight, but Feversham warned him that, though the men were steady, few of his officers could
be depended on. Before leaving London the King had called his chief captains together and offered
passes to all who were desirous to leave him for the Prince of Orange, "to spare them," he
said, "the shame of deserting their lawful sovereign." All were profuse in professions of loyalty,
and among them were Churchill, Grafton, and the butcher Kirke. Churchill, we know, continued
these professions up to the eleventh hour. On the evening of the 24th James held a council
of war, in which Churchill's voice was loudest for battle. That night he left Salisbury for
Axminster, and Grafton went with him. Some of the Scottish officers stood firm, but not all.
Dumbarton offered to lead his regiment alone against the enemy. Dundee urged James to do one
of three things: to fight the Prince, to demand from him in person his business in England,
or to retire into Scotland with his faithful troops. But the King still hesitated, and while
he hesitated the moment passed. Kirke, who commanded the advance guard at Warminster, flatly
refused to obey the orders sent him from Salisbury, and a rumour spread that he had gone over
to William with all his men. The King broke up the camp and began his retreat to London; and
before he had got farther on his way than Andover, Ormonde and Prince George had joined the
deserters, taking with them young Drumlanrig. Douglas did not himself go over; but one of his
battalions did, without any attempt on his part to stop them. He had sounded Dundee on the
expediency of making terms for themselves with William; but as he had done so under an oath
of secrecy, Dundee felt himself bound in honour to keep silence, and we may suppose made it
a part of the bargain that Douglas should stay where he was.

James left no orders behind him, and after his retreat the movements of his army are somewhat
confused. Dundee marched his cavalry to Reading, where he was joined by Dumbarton. Thence they
were ordered to Uxbridge to consult with Feversham on the chances of a battle. But hardly had
they got there when the latter received orders to disband the army, and heard at the same time
of the King's flight from London. The Scottish troops clamoured for Dundee to lead them back
to their country. He marched them to Watford, and while there, it is said, received a letter
from William, who had now advanced to Hungerford, bidding him stay where he was and none should
harm him.[75] According to Balcarres, Dundee made at once for London on the news of the King's
flight, and was still there on his return. But the fact is that few of these contemporary writers
descend to dates, and it is almost impossible therefore to track any one man's movements through
those troubled days. It is, however, certain that a meeting of the Scottish Council was summoned
in London by Hamilton at some period between James's first flight and his return, and that
Dundee attended it. That Hamilton meditated declaring for William is certain, and that he would
have taken all his colleagues with him, except Dundee and Balcarres, is probable; but the King's
sudden return to Whitehall postponed matters for a time.

James reached London from Rochester on the afternoon of Sunday, December 16th. William was
then at Windsor, and James expressed a wish to meet him in London, offering St. James's Palace
for his quarters. William sent an answer that he could not come to London while there were
any troops there not under his command. On the 17th a council was held at Windsor, with Halifax
in the chair, to determine what should be done with James. William himself would not be present.
It was decided that James must, at any rate, leave London, and the decision was brought to
him that night as he lay asleep in bed. No resistance was possible, had any been intended.
The Dutch had occupied Chelsea and Kensington early in the afternoon; and when Halifax, Shrewsbury,
and Delamere arrived with their message from Windsor, three battalions of foot, with some troops
of horse, were bivouacked in St. James's Park, and Dutch sentinels were posted at Whitehall.

Early on the morning of the 17th Dundee and Balcarres had waited on the King. None were with
him but some gentlemen of his bedchamber. Balcarres told him that he had orders from his colleagues
to promise that, if the King would give the word, an army of twenty thousand men should be
ready within four-and-twenty hours. "My lord," replied James, "I know you to be my friend,
sincere and honourable: the men who sent you are not so, and I expect nothing from them." It
was a fine morning, and he said he should like a walk. Balcarres and Dundee attended him into
the Mall. When they had got there the King asked them, how came they still to be with him when
all the world had forsaken him for the Prince of Orange? Both answered that their fidelity
to so good a master would be ever the same, and that they had nothing to do with the Prince
of Orange. "Will you two," then asked the King, "say you have still attachment to me?" "Sir,"
was the answer, "we do." "Will you give me your hands upon it as men of honour?" They did so.
"Well," said the King, "I see you are the men I always took you to be; you shall know all my
intentions. I can no longer remain here but as a cypher, or to be a prisoner to the Prince
of Orange, and you know there is but a small distance between the prisons and the graves of
kings. Therefore I go for France immediately; when there you shall have my instructions--you,
Lord Balcarres, shall have a commission to manage my civil affairs, and you, Lord Dundee, to
command my troops in Scotland."

They then parted. On the next morning, the morning of the 18th, in dark and rainy weather,
the royal barge was ready at Whitehall stairs, under an escort of boats filled with Dutch soldiers.
Halifax, with his colleagues from Windsor, attended the King to the water-side. Dumbarton,
Arran, and a few others followed him down the river, and stayed by him during the few painful
days he lingered at Rochester. At dawn of the 23rd James left England for ever.

Dundee stayed on in London. His regiment had been disbanded, and the rest of the Scottish forces,
after a spirited but futile attempt to take matters into their own hands, had settled quietly
down under their new colonels, some of the most doubtful ones being sent out of harm's way
to Holland. Dunmore had thrown up his command, and his dragoons were now in the charge of Sir
Thomas Livingstone. Schomberg was placed, to their intense disgust, at the head of Dumbarton's
infantry, once James's favourite regiment. Some of his old troopers, however, still kept by
the captain whom they had known as Claverhouse.

Hamilton and his party pressed William to exempt from the general amnesty certain members of
the Scottish Council whom they named as particular and unscrupulous instruments of James's
tyranny, and unsafe to be let go at large. But the Prince with his usual good sense refused
to drive any man into opposition: the past even of the most guilty should, he said, be forgotten
till he was forced to remember it. Against Dundee and Balcarres he had been especially warned.
He remembered both well: Balcarres had married a lady of his family, and Dundee had fought
by his side. He asked them both to enter his service. They refused, and Balcarres, plainly
avowing the commission entrusted to him by James, asked if, in such circumstances, he could
honourably take service with another. "I cannot say that you can," was the answer, "but take
care that you fall not within the law, for otherwise I shall be forced against my will to let
the law overtake you." Dundee was told that if he would live quietly at home, no allegiance
should be exacted from him and no harm done to him. He answered that he would live quietly,
if he were not forced to live otherwise. Early in February the two friends left London for
Edinburgh.[76]

was succeeded in the command by Dunmore. Napier gives the muster-roll of Claverhouse's regiment
for May, 1685. It consisted of six troops, of which the colonel, as the custom then was, commanded
the first in person, the other captains being Lords Drumlanrig, Ross, Airlie, Balcarres, and
William Douglas; hardly the men, perhaps, to sanction the pranks of Macaulay's Apollyons and
Beelzebubs. Napier also quotes an amusing passage in a letter from Athole to Queensberry, which,
as he says, may recall memories of a certain historic injunction of later times, "to take care
of Dowb." Athole had been superseded in his command of the Life Guards by Montrose, and when
the latter fell sick, made interest with Queensberry to be reinstated. "As you will oblige
me," the passage runs, "pray remember Geordie Murray [who held a commission in the regiment],
but not in wrath."

[76] It is not clear that Dundee had an audience of William. Macaulay says in one place that
he was not ungraciously received at Saint James's, and in another that he employed the mediations
of Burnet. Both statements are of course compatible with each other. The latter rests on Burnet's
own authority; but for the former I can find none in any of the writers from whom Macaulay
has taken his narrative of these days. Dalrymple's words are, "Dundee refused without ceremony,"
which may mean anything. It is, I think, not improbable that William employed Burnet to sound
Dundee, and that the good bishop, among whose qualities tact was not pre-eminent, managing
the matter clumsily, met with an unceremonious refusal for his pains. The point, however, is
of no importance. It is clear enough that William, would have been glad to see both men in
his service, and that they both declined to enter it. As Macaulay has called Dundee's conduct
disingenuous, apparently on Burnet's authority, it may be well to give the bishop's own words.
"He [Dundee] had employed me to carry messages from him to the King, to know what security
he might expect if he should go and live in Scotland without owning his government. The King
said, if he would live peaceably, and at home, he would protect him: to this he answered, that,
unless he was forced to it, he would live quietly." "History of My Own Time," iii. 29. Macaulay's
paraphrase is as follows. "Dundee seems to have been less ingenuous. He employed the mediation
of Burnet, opened a negotiation with Saint James's, declared himself willing to acquiesce in
the new order of things, obtained from William a promise of protection, and promised in return
to live peaceably. Such credit was given to his professions, that he was suffered to travel
down to Scotland under the escort of a troop of cavalry." "History of England," iv. 281. I
do not think the text quite bears out the commentary; and indeed elsewhere in the chapter Macaulay
seems inclined to allow more credit to these professions. The "escort" under which Dundee was
"suffered to travel" consisted of his own troopers, who had followed him from Watford to London,
and stayed with him to the end.

CHAPTER IX.

All eyes were now turned to Scotland. England had practically accepted William, and although
the terms of acceptance were still in some quarters kept open to question, there was no longer
fear that the final answer would have to be given by the sword. In Scotland the case was different.
Many of the great nobles and other dignitaries had indeed professed themselves in favour of
William, but political morality, a custom nowhere in those days very rigidly observed, may
be said to have been honoured by Scottish statesmen almost wholly in the breach. No man trusted
his neighbour, and his neighbour was perfectly aware of the fact. It was impossible to say
what an hour might not bring forth; and in this flux of things no man could guarantee that
the Whigs of to-day would not be the Jacobites of to-morrow. Hamilton was the recognised leader
of the Whigs, Athole of the Jacobites. Both were great and powerful noblemen. The influence
of Hamilton was supreme in the Western Lowlands: only Mac Callum More could muster to his standard
a larger gathering than the lord of Blair, and the glory of Mac Callum More was now in eclipse.
Yet Hamilton had been one of James' Privy Councillors, and had not declared for William till
the Dutch guards were at Whitehall. His son Arran and his brother Dumbarton were both on the
other side: Arran had accompanied James to Rochester, and Dumbarton had refused to hold his
commission under the Prince of Orange. Athole had more than once coquetted with the Whigs,
and his present Jacobitism was shrewdly suspected to be due to the coolness with which his
advances had been received: his son Lord Murray, who had married a daughter of Hamilton, had
declared for William. These great noblemen had indeed the satisfaction of feeling that, however
the die might fall, their titles and estates were at least secured. But the wisdom of their
family arrangements did not increase their reputation with their parties. The Duke of Gordon
held the castle of Edinburgh for James; and, though the Duke was a weak creature, his position
was strong. The bulk of the common people were undoubtedly Whigs: the bishops, and the clergy
generally, were, if not exactly Jacobites, undoubtedly Tories.

There were religious troubles of course to swell the political ones. When the news of James's
flight reached Edinburgh, Perth had been imprudently induced to disband the militia, and the
Covenanters had been quick to take advantage of the imprudence. The Episcopal clergymen were
rabbled throughout all the western shires. Their houses were sacked, and themselves and their
families insulted and sometimes beaten: the churches were locked, and the keys carried off
in triumph by the pious zealots. In Glasgow the Cathedral was attacked, and the congregation
pelted through the streets. In Edinburgh Holyrood Palace was carried by storm: the Catholic
chapel, which James had built and adorned with great splendour, was gutted, and the printing-press,
employed to publish tracts in favour of the Catholic religion, was broken up. Perth fled for
his life, but was overtaken at sea, carried back and lodged in Stirling Castle, followed by
the threats and curses of the mob. Such was the temper of the Scottish nation when the Convention
of Estates, summoned by William, met at Edinburgh on March 14th, 1689.

The Act depriving the Presbyterians of the franchise had been annulled, and the elections had
gone strongly in favour of the Whigs. Hamilton had been chosen President by a majority of forty
votes over Athole, whereupon twenty ardent Jacobites went straightway over to the other side.
The next thing to be done was to get rid of Gordon. It was impossible, they said, for a free
Parliament to deliberate under the shadow of hostile guns. Two of his friends, the Earls of
Lothian and Tweeddale, were accordingly sent to the Duke with a message from the Convention,
offering him favourable terms of surrender. He asked a night for consideration; but during
the night he was also visited by Dundee and Balcarres. They showed him the commissions entrusted
to them by James, and told him that if things did not go better for their party they had resolved
to exercise their power of summoning a new Convention to Stirling. At his request Dundee also
gave him a paper guaranteeing his action in holding the castle as most necessary to the cause.
On the following day, when the earls returned, Gordon told them he had decided not to surrender
his trust except upon terms too extravagant to be seriously considered. He was accordingly
summoned in form by the heralds: guards were posted round the castle, and all communications
between it and the town declared treasonable. The Duke replied by a largess of money to the
heralds to drink King James's health, telling them that they should in common decency have
turned the King's coats they wore on their backs before they came to declare the King's subjects
traitors.

Meanwhile a messenger had arrived with a sealed despatch for the Estates from James. It seemed
strange both to Dundee and Balcarres that the message had not been to them, or at least accompanied
by a letter informing them of its purport; but they had no suspicion of its contents, and willingly
agreed to the terms on which the Whigs consented to hear it read. These terms were, that the
Convention was a legal and free meeting, and would accept no order to dissolve until it had
secured the liberty and religion of Scotland. The vote was passed, and the letter was read,
to the consternation of the Jacobites and the delight of the Whigs. Of all the foolish acts
committed by James the despatch of this letter was, in the circumstances, the most foolish.
Not a word did it contain of any intention to respect the religion or the liberty of men whom
it still professed to address as subjects. Pardon was promised to all who should return to
their allegiance within a fortnight: to all others punishment was threatened in this world,
and damnation in the next. Nothing was wanting to heighten the imprudence. The letter was in
the handwriting of Melfort, who was equally odious to both parties; and it had been preceded
by one from William expressed in terms as wise and moderate as the others were headstrong and
foolish. But the feeling of the more temperate Jacobites will best be shown in the account
Balcarres himself gave to his master of the effect produced by this fatal epistle. "When the
messenger was announced," he wrote,

     "His coming was joyful to us, expecting a letter from your
     Majesty to the Convention, in terms suitable to the bad
     situation of your affairs in England, and as had been
     advised by your friends before we left London; and so
     assured were they of their advices being followed, that they
     had encouraged all the loyal party, and engaged many to come
     to the Convention, in hopes such full satisfaction would be
     given in matters of religion and liberty, that even most of
     those who had declared against you would return to their
     duty. But, as in place of such a letter as was expected, or
     letters to particular persons, as was advised, came a letter
     from your Majesty to the Convention, without any copy to
     show your friends, in terms absolutely different from those
     we had agreed upon, and sent to your Majesty by Mr. Lindsay
     from London. Upon other occasions such a letter might have
     passed, if there had been power to have backed it, or force
     to make good its reception; but after the Parliament of
     England had refused to read a letter from your Majesty
     because of the Earl of Melfort's countersigning it [and
     considering] that England had made the Prince of Orange
     their King, and that it was known you had none to sustain
     your cause but those who advised letters of another strain,
     it was a fault of your advisers hardly to be pardoned....
     Crane was brought in and the letter read, with the same
     order and respect observed upon such occasions to our Kings;
     but no sooner was it twice read and known to be Earl
     Melfort's hand and style, but the house was in a
     tumult--your enemies in joy and your friends in confusion.
     Glad were your enemies to find nothing so much as promised
     of what we had asserted should be done for their
     satisfaction, [they] having much feared many of their party
     would have forsaken them if your Majesty's letter had been
     written in the terms we advised from London. Mr. Crane could
     give no account why the advice of your friends was not
     followed, but Mr. Lindsay made no secret of it after he came
     back from St. Germain's, but informed us that, after he had
     delivered to [the] Earl of Melfort the letters and advices
     of your friends at London to your Majesty, his Lordship kept
     him retired, and he was not suffered to attend you--fearing
     that what he had written to your Majesty relating to his
     Lordship might spoil his project of going to Ireland with
     you. We had observed at London the great aversion men of all
     professions had at his being employed, and we knew he was in
     no better esteem in his own country, which made us entreat
     your Majesty to leave him in France, and some, upon his own
     account, advised his not coming over, knowing the danger he
     might be in; but his Lordship either suppressed our letters
     or gave our advices another turn than was intended, by which
     all our hopes of succeeding in the Convention vanished, nor
     was ever seen so great an alteration as was observed at the
     next meeting after your letter was read, which made all your
     friends resolve to leave Edinburgh and to call a Convention
     of Estates at Stirling, as your Majesty had given the
     Archbishop of St. Andrews, the Viscount of Dundee, and
     myself the power to do this by a warrant sent by Mr. Brown
     from Ireland."

Dundee was anxious to be gone. He saw that the game was up in the Convention, and there were
other reasons. For many days past troops of strange, fierce-looking men, carrying arms but
half-concealed beneath their plaids, had been flocking into Edinburgh. These were the men of
the hill-sides and moorlands of the West, the wild Western Whigs, who feared and hated the
name of Claverhouse more than anything on earth. Their leader was William Cleland, a survivor
from the fields of Drumclog and Bothwell, a brave and able young man, of good education and
humane above his fellows, but who, it was well known, was burning to have vengeance upon Dundee.
Some of these men had been heard to mutter that the tables were turned now, and "bloodly Clavers"
should play the persecutor no more. Word was brought to Dundee that a plot was on foot to assassinate
him and Sir George Mackenzie, the most hated of all James's lawyers. Whether the rumour were
true or not, it was at least too probable to be disregarded. Dundee laid the matter before
Hamilton, offered to produce his witnesses, and demanded that these armed strangers be ordered
to leave the town. Hamilton (who was, in fact, responsible for their presence) answered that
the Convention had more important matters to think of, that the city could not be left defenceless
to Gordon and his rebellious garrison, and, it is said, twitted Dundee with imaginary fears
unbecoming a brave man.

A meeting of the Jacobites was held. It was decided to call a fresh Convention at Stirling.
Mar, who held the castle there, professed himself staunch, and Athole promised to have a force
of his Highlanders in readiness. This was on Saturday, March 16th: it was determined to leave
Edinburgh on the following Monday.

When Monday came Athole proposed to wait another day. As his co-operation was of the greatest
importance, his proposal was accepted. But Dundee would wait no longer. In vain Balcarres told
him that his haste would ruin all their plans. He answered that he would take no action without
the agreement of the rest, but in Edinburgh he would stay no longer. He had made an appointment
for that day with some friends outside the walls, and he could not break it. His troopers had
been in readiness since an early hour, and Dundee returning to his lodgings gave signal to
mount. The streets were thronged with scowling faces, but they shrank to right and left as
those stern riders came clattering down the Canongate. A friend called from the crowd to know
whither they went. Dundee raised his hat from his head and answered: "Wherever the spirit of
Montrose shall direct me." When clear of the walls he led his men to the left up the Leith
Wynd and along the bank of the North Loch, the ground now occupied by the busy and handsome
thoroughfare known as Prince's Street. The road to Stirling winds beneath the Castle rock,
and as the cavalcade came on, their leader saw the Duke on the ramparts, making signals to
him for an interview. Dundee dismounted, and scrambled up the steep face of the rock. What
passed between them is not clearly known. Balcarres says Dundee told the Duke of the design
for Stirling, and once more prayed him to stand firm. But it seems clear that Dundee had by
that time abandoned all hopes of a fresh Convention, and it is doubtful whether he had any
definite plan in his mind. Dalrymple's report of the conversation seems more likely to be the
true one. According to him Dundee pressed the Duke to come north with him, leaving the castle
to the charge of the Lieutenant-Governor, Winram, a man who had made himself too odious to
the people to leave room for any doubt of his fidelity to James. But these bold ventures were
not to the Duke's taste: his courage was of that sort which shows best behind stone walls:
and his answer was ingeniously framed to conceal his timidity under a show of discipline. "A
soldier," he said, "cannot in honour quit the post that is assigned to him."

Meanwhile the city was in an uproar. A number of people had gathered round the foot of the
rock to stare at the strange sight. The watchers from the city magnified this idle crowd into
a hostile force. A messenger came in haste to the Convention with the news that Dundee was
at the gates with an army, and that the Duke of Gordon was preparing to fire on the town.

Hamilton, who, while affairs were still in the balance, had behaved with unexpected moderation,
now gave loose to his temper. The time had come, he said, for all good friends of order to
see to their safety when enemies to their liberties and religion were taking arms. There was
danger within as well as without. The traitors must be kept close; but true men had nothing
to fear, for thousands were ready to start up in their defence at the stamp of his foot. He
then ordered the room to be locked, and the keys to be laid on the table. The drums beat to
arms: the town-guard, and such force of militia as was still in the city, fell in; while from
garrets and cellars the Westland men came thronging into the streets, with weapons in their
hands, and in their faces fury and fear of their terrible enemy. After a time, as the news
came that Dundee had ridden off northward and that all seemed quiet in the castle, the tumult
subsided. The doors of the Parliament House were opened, and the members came out. Hamilton
and his party were greeted with loud cheers: threats and execrations no less loud assailed
the few and downcast Jacobites. From that memorable day the friends of William had nothing
more to fear in the capital of Scotland. For a while, indeed, some show of opposition was still
maintained, faintly stimulated by the arrival of Queensberry from London. But he had come too
late. His power was no longer what it had been; nor were his professions of loyalty regarded
by men like Balcarres as above all suspicion. For Queensberry had been wise with the wisdom
of Hamilton and Athole. The great House of Douglas was prudently divided against itself, and
come what might it should not fall. And Athole now, after with great show of bravery urging
Gordon to fire on the town, had grown somewhat less than lukewarm, while Mar, the Governor
of Stirling Castle, put an end for ever to any thoughts of a fresh Convention in that city
by boldly declaring for William. The hopes and the hearts of the Jacobites had gone northward
with Dundee; and in truth there was not at this moment a brave company of either.

Dundee did not draw rein in Stirling. He galloped through the town, across the bridge, and
on by Dunblane, where he stayed the night, to his own home at Dudhope, where his lady was then
waiting her confinement. The only man of his own quality who had ridden with him from Edinburgh
was George Livingstone, Lord Linlithgow's son, whose troop of Life Guards had been taken from
him in the general re-arrangement of regiments that had followed the fiasco of Salisbury; and
he had left his companion on the road to make for Lord Strathmore's house at Glamis. For a
week of unwonted quiet, the last he was to know on earth, Dundee rested at Dudhope. Then his
enemies found him. On the morning of the 26th Hamilton's messengers appeared before his gates,
summoning him to lay down his arms and return to his duty at the Convention, on pain of being
proclaimed traitor and outlaw. Dundee replied by a letter which, as it has been styled both
disrespectful and disingenuous, it is worth while to print in full.

     "Dudhope, March 27th, 1689.

     "May it please your Grace:--The coming of an herald and
     trumpeter to summon a man to lay down arms that is living in
     peace at home, seems to me a very extraordinary thing, and,
     I suppose, will do so to all that hear of it. While I
     attended the Convention at Edinburgh I complained often of
     many people being in arms without authority, which was
     notoriously known to be true; even the wild hill-men; and no
     summons to lay down arms under the pain of treason being
     given them, I thought it unsafe for me to remain longer
     among them. And because a few of my friends did me the
     favour to convey me out of the reach of these murderers, and
     that my Lord Livingstone and several other officers took
     occasion to come away at the same time, this must be called
     being in arms. We did not exceed the number allowed by the
     Meeting of Estates. My Lord Livingstone and I might have had
     each of us ten; and four or five officers that were in
     company might have had a certain number allowed them; which
     being, it will be found we exceeded not. I am sure it is far
     short of the number my Lord Lorn was seen to march with. And
     though I had gone away with some more than ordinary, who can
     blame me when designs of murdering me was made appear?
     Besides, it is known to everybody that, before we came
     within sixteen miles of this, my Lord Livingstone went off
     to his brother, my Lord Strathmore's, house; and most of the
     officers and several of the company went to their respective
     homes or relations. And, if any of them did me the favour to
     come along with me, must that be called being in arms? Sure,
     when your Grace represents this to the Meeting of the
     States, they will discharge such a groundless pursuit, and
     think my appearance before them unnecessary. Besides, though
     it were necessary for me to go and attend the meeting, I
     cannot come with freedom and safety, because I am informed
     there are men-of-war and foreign troops in the passage; and
     till I know what they are and what are their orders, the
     Meeting cannot blame me for not coming. Then, my Lord,
     seeing the summons has proceeded on a groundless story, I
     hope the Meeting of States will think it unreasonable I
     should leave my wife in the condition she is in. If there be
     anybody that, notwithstanding of all that is said, thinks I
     ought to appear, I beg the favour of a delay till my wife is
     brought to bed; and in the meantime I will either give
     security or parole not to disturb the peace. Seeing this
     pursuit is so groundless, and so reasonable things offered,
     and the Meeting composed of prudent men and men of honour,
     and your Grace presiding in it, I have no reason to fear
     further trouble.

     "I am, may it please your Grace, your most humble servant,

     "DUNDEE.

     "I beg your Grace will cause this read to the Meeting,
     because it is all the defence I have made. I sent another to
     your Grace from Dunblane with the reasons of my leaving
     Edinburgh. I know not if it be come to your hands."

The letter was read to the Convention on the following day, and on Saturday, March 30th, John
Graham, Viscount of Dundee, was proclaimed traitor with all the usual ceremonies. Thrice was
his name called within the Parliament House, and thrice outside its doors, and thrice with
sound of trumpet at the market-cross of the good town of Edinburgh.

About the same time happened a still more untoward thing. James was now in Ireland. He had
learned how matters had gone in Scotland, and conceived that the moment for action had come.
A commission was accordingly despatched to Dundee, constituting him Lieutenant-General and
Commander-in-Chief in Scotland, together with a letter in James's own hand, informing him that
five thousand foot and three hundred horse would presently be at his disposal. There were letters
also from Melfort both to Dundee and Balcarres. Either by the folly or the knavery of the messenger
the papers fell into the hands of Hamilton, who read them to the Convention. As usual, Melfort's
letters were in the most foolish and violent language. "You will ask no doubt," he wrote to
Dundee, "how we shall be able to pay our armies; but can you ask such a question while our
enemies, the rebels, have estates to be forfeited? We will begin with the great and end with
the small ones." To Balcarres he wrote in the same strain. "The estates of the rebels will
recompense us. You know there were several lords whom we marked out, when you and I were together,
who deserved no better fate. When we get the power, we will make these men hewers of wood and
drawers of water." No man was mentioned by name, so that each man was at liberty to take these
threats for himself. "You hear," cried Hamilton, "you hear, my lords and gentlemen, our sentence
pronounced. We must take our choice, to die, or to defend ourselves." There was a terrible
uproar, the new Whig recruits being among the loudest in their exposition of the dangers to
which their love for their religion and their country was likely to expose them. Leven was
ordered with two hundred of his new regiment to arrest both Dundee and Balcarres.[77] The latter
was taken easily enough, and clapped into the Tolbooth. But Dundee got wind of his danger,
and was off before the soldiers could reach Dudhope. He went northward still, to Glen Ogilvy,
his wife's jointure-house, in the parish of Glamis, not far from the old historic castle of
Macbeth; and thither Leven did not think it prudent to pursue him.

FOOTNOTES:

[77] During the first alarm raised by Dundee's departure the Convention had passed an order
to raise and arm a regiment of eight hundred men, and had given the command to Leven. It is
said that the men were found within two hours. See "An Account of the Proceedings of the Estates
in Scotland," London, 1689.

CHAPTER X.

Dundee had ridden out of Edinburgh with no clear plan of action before him. Balcarres afterwards
declared that his friend had no intention of making for the Highlands till he learned that
warrants were out for his apprehension. Yet it is probable that the idea of a Highland campaign
had already begun to take shape in Dundee's mind before Mackay's advance forced him over the
Grampians. His orders were, in the event of the Estates declaring for William, to keep quiet
till the arrival of a regular force from Ireland should enable him to take the field with some
chance of success. And, indeed, he had at that time no alternative. It was clear to him that
the game was lost in the Lowlands, but it was not yet clear to him that anything was to be
gained in the Highlands. The example of his famous kinsman might indeed serve to fire both
his imagination and his ambition; but it could hardly serve to make him hopeful of succeeding
with the weapons which had failed Montrose. A few thousand claymores would no doubt prove a
useful supplement to the small body of troops James might be able to spare from Ireland; but
even a mind so ardent and sanguine as Dundee's might well have shrank from facing the chances
of war with no other resources than a handful of troopers and a rabble of half-armed, half-naked,
and wholly undisciplined savages. And in truth experience had shown that these fierce and jealous
spirits were little less dangerous as allies than as enemies. Every clan had its hereditary
feud, and no one could say that on the day of battle the claymores might not be drawn against
each other instead of against the common foe. Branches even of the same stock did not conceive
themselves inevitably bound by the tie of blood, though it was a claim never forgotten when
it was convenient to make or allow it. Sometimes a few of the smaller clans would make common
cause against the oppressions of a more powerful, or the cattle of a wealthier neighbour; but
it was rarely that friendship went beyond the conditions of an armed neutrality. Though the
feudal system had long prevailed in many parts of the Highlands, it had never superseded the
older patriarchal system. The chief of the clan might pay homage to a great lord like Argyle
or Athole; but in the clan he was king, and his word was law. Moreover, brave as the Highlanders
undoubtedly were, they were not a warlike race. They would rise to the signal of the fiery
cross, without questioning the cause; and they would on occasion fight for their own hand,
for revenge or plunder. But the long service of a regular war was little to their taste. Of
military science and military discipline they knew nothing. To win the battle with the rush
of the first onset, and when the battle was won to make off to their homes with all the plunder
they could lay hands on,--this was their notion of warfare, and it was a notion which the chiefs
were too ignorant or too prudent to interfere with. What chance could there be of inducing
such spirits as these to combine in one great confederacy, and to undertake a long and desperate
struggle for the sake of a king of whom the most part had never heard, and of a cause which
they could not understand?

But Dundee had learned something at Dunblane which had given him fresh views. During the few
hours he had passed there he had talked much with a Highland gentleman, Alexander Drummond
of Bahaldy, son-in-law to Sir Ewan Cameron of Lochiel, the great chief of the clan Cameron.
Drummond told him that Lochiel had been busy all the winter among his neighbours, that they
were now ripe for war, and were only waiting a leader and some succours of regular troops and
ammunition; that James had been communicated with, and had approved their plan in a letter
written with his own hand to Lochiel; and that an early day had been appointed for a rendezvous
of the clans in Lochaber, the headquarters of the Camerons.

It is now generally acknowledged that on this occasion, however it may have been in the next
century, the action of the Highland chiefs was not inspired by devotion to the House of Stuart.
Lochiel himself may indeed have been moved by some personal consideration for the exiled King.
He had fought bravely under Montrose for Charles the First, and under Middleton for Charles
the Second. From the latter King he had received more than one letter full of those flattering
assurances Charles knew so well how to make. By James he had been graciously welcomed at Whitehall,
and had received the honour of knighthood from the royal hand. He was brave, wise, generous,
and faithful, and, even in a less rude society than that in which his lot was cast, his manners
would have been called agreeable and his education certainly not contemptible. But even Lochiel's
loyalty was not suffered to run counter to his interests. In Lochaber the name of James was
as nothing compared with the name of Evan Dhu, and the law of the King of England gave place
to the law of the great Chief of the Camerons. As for the rest, the dispute between Whigs and
Jacobites was no more to them than the dispute between the Guelphs and Ghibellines had been
to their ancestors. They cared not the value of a single sheep whether James or William sat
on the throne of Great Britain, so long as neither interfered with them. No later than the
previous year the authority of James had been insulted and his soldiers beaten by one of these
independent lordlings--Colin Macdonald of Keppoch, familiarly known as Coll of the Cows, for
his skill in tracking his neighbour's cattle over the wildest mountains to the most secret
coverts.[78]

But for what loyalty to the House of Stuart was powerless to effect a motive was found in the
hatred to the House of Argyle. Nearly all the chiefs of the Western Highlands were vassals
to Mac Callum More, the head of the great clan of Campbell. The numerous branches of the Macdonalds,
who had once been lords of the Hebrides and all the mountain districts of Argyleshire and Invernessshire,
the Camerons, the Macnaghtens, the Macleans, the Stuarts of Appin, all these paid tribute (it
would be probably more correct to say owed tribute) to the Marquis of Argyle, and all were
ready to welcome any chance of freedom from that odious bondage. The early loyalty of Lochiel
had probably been as much inspired by the fact that he was fighting against an Argyle as for
a Stuart, as it is possible had been the loyalty of Montrose himself. In 1685 he had cheerfully
summoned his clan to repel the invasion of another chief of that hated House; and now the Revolution
had brought back from exile yet another to exercise the old tyranny. This was enough to make
the Revolution a hateful thing in the eyes of Lochiel and his neighbours. But it was also believed
that James had conceived the idea of buying up from the great Highland nobles their feudal
rights over the clans, and had only been prevented from carrying his idea into effect by the
Revolution. In the minds of these Western chiefs, then, William was the oppressor and James
the deliverer. Throughout the winter they had watched eagerly for news from the South. At length
they learned that the Estates had declared for William; that their prime enemy was restored
to favour and power; and that Dundee, whose exploits against the party of which for three generations
an Argyle had been the acknowledged head were well known to them, was an outlaw and a fugitive.
In him they at once recognised the leader for whom they waited. Drummond was accordingly sent
to invite him to their councils, and to promise that a sufficient escort should be ready at
the proper time to convey him to the appointed meeting-place.

Meanwhile it had become necessary for Dundee to look to his own safety. A more dangerous enemy
than Leven was now in the field against him. As soon as William had learned the decision of
the Estates he had despatched a body of troops into Scotland under General Mackay. Hugh Mackay,
of Scourie, was himself of a Highland stock. Like Dundee, he had learned the art of war first
in France, and afterwards in the Low Countries, where he had risen to the command of the Scots
Brigade, as those regiments were called which upwards of a century before the new Protestant
enthusiasm of England had raised to support Holland against the tyranny of Spain. He was a
good man, a brave if not a dashing soldier, a prudent tactician, and well skilled in all the
machinery of war.

Mackay at first contented himself with sending Livingstone and his dragoons after Dundee, while
he turned his attention to Gordon, who was still maintaining some show of resistance in the
castle. But Livingstone was too late. He found the nest warm, but the bird had flown. Dundee
had gone northwards over the Grampians into the Gordons' country, where the Earl of Dunfermline,
the Duke's brother-in-law, at once joined him with a most welcome addition to his little band
of troopers. Mackay foresaw that the Highlands were to be the real scene of operations, and
that no danger need be apprehended from the vapouring Gordon. He sent word, therefore, to Livingstone
to await him in Dundee, and marched himself for that place with some two hundred of his own
brigade and one hundred and twenty of Lord Colchester's dragoons.[79]

It is as difficult for the reader to follow Dundee through these April days as Mackay found
it. In the sounding hexameters of the "Grameis," his movements are indeed described with more
labour than lucidity; but at this early stage of the campaign it is not necessary to track
him over every mountain and river, and by every town and castle.[80] It will be enough to say
that in an incredibly short space of time he beat up for recruits the greater part of the counties
of Aberdeen, Inverness, and Perth, while the bewildered Mackay, whose training and troops were
alike unfitted to this sort of campaigning, toiled after him in vain. He also found time for
a flying visit to Dudhope, where his wife had been safely delivered of a son. He can have stayed
with her but a day at most; and when he left her, he was to see her face no more.

From Dudhope Dundee crossed the Grampians again for Inverness. Here it had been arranged for
him to meet Keppoch and the promised escort of Highlanders. And here, accordingly, he found
them; but he also found a state of things which gave him a lively foretaste of the character
and conduct of his new allies.

Between the clan of Macdonald and the clan of Mackintosh there had existed for many centuries
a deadly feud, the exact origin of which had long been lost in the mists of fable. On the other
hand, a good understanding had long existed between the Mackintoshes and the town of Inverness.
Though the town in those days consisted only of some five hundred mean buildings surrounded
by a crazy wall, the busy little colony of artisans which inhabited it, and the occasional
visit of a trading vessel to its port, had invested it among the Highlanders with the reputation
of vast wealth. Here was an opportunity for gratifying his love of revenge and his love of
plunder which Keppoch was not the man to lose. He advanced through the territory of the Mackintoshes,
harrying and burning as he marched, up to the walls of Inverness. For two days he lay before
its crazy gates threatening fire and sword, while the burghers mustered to arms within, and
the ministers exhorted them from the market-place. Such was the state of affairs Dundee found
when he and his troopers rode into the Highland camp on the first day of May.

Keppoch tried to excuse himself. The town, he said, owed him money, and he sought only to recover
his own. On the other hand, the magistrates said that he had forced them to promise him four
thousand marks. Dundee answered that Keppoch had no warrant from him to be in arms, much less
to plunder. But it was not yet safe for him with his handful of horse to use such brave language
to the chief at the head of his eight hundred claymores. He therefore temporised. By his advice
the magistrates agreed to pay two thousand dollars: half of this sum was raised on the spot
with some difficulty: for the other half Dundee gave his bond to Keppoch. He also promised
the magistrates that, when James was restored to his throne, the money should be refunded to
them. Dundee had saved the town, but for the present he had lost his allies. Keppoch and his
thieves, laden with the silver of Inverness and the cattle of the Mackintoshes, retired in
dudgeon to their mountains.

But Dundee was destined to achieve something before he joined the muster at Lochaber. After
he had parted from Keppoch he turned westward down the valley of the Ness, by the noble castle
of Glengarry, which Cumberland destroyed after Culloden, by Kilcummin, where Fort Augustus
now stands, memorable in his eyes as the spot whence Montrose had led the clans to break the
power of the Campbells at Inverlochy, and so southwards again through the forest of Badenoch
to the Tay. As he was painfully toiling through this vast and rugged recruiting-ground word
was brought to him that a regiment of cavalry was being raised in Perth under the auspices
of the Laird of Blair, a rich and powerful gentleman who had married into Hamilton's family.
He determined on a bold stroke. He was sorely in need of powder, provisions, money, and especially
of fresh mounts for his troopers, the long rapid marches, cold weather, and scanty forage having
reduced his horses to a very sorry plight. In Perth he might lay hands on all these, and possibly
on a few recruits into the bargain. He was in Blair when the messengers found him on May 10th.
With his handful of sabres he swooped down on Dunkeld, which he reached just in time to relieve
a tax-collector of the dues he had been successfully raising for William. At Dunkeld he rested
his men till nightfall, and then rode straight for Perth. At two o'clock in the morning he
entered the city, surprised Blair and his lieutenant, Pollock, in their beds, collected forty
horses, a store of arms and powder, some provisions, and some of the public money, and was
off again with his booty and his prisoners before the startled citizens had fairly realised
the weakness of their invaders. He recrossed the Tay, and halted at Scone to refresh himself
and his men at the charges of Lord Stormont, an involuntary act of hospitality on the latter's
part for which he had some trouble to excuse himself in Edinburgh.[81]

While in the wilds of Badenoch Dundee had received another message which had interested him
much. In the dragoons now under Livingstone's command were several of Dunmore's old officers
still well affected to James. Chief among these were William Livingstone,[82] a relation of
the colonel, and that Captain Creichton of whom mention has been already made. While lying
in garrison at Dundee Creichton found means to get secretly into Dudhope, and to assure Lady
Dundee that he and many of his comrades were only waiting an opportunity to join her husband.
She sent off word of this to the wanderer, who managed to convey an assurance to Creichton
of his plans, and of the strength of the reinforcements he expected from Ireland. On their
landing, he added, he should expect the dragoons to join him.

This note was received by Creichton from the hands of a ragged Highlander two days after he
had marched with a part of his regiment to join Mackay at Inverness. Could he have waited a
little longer he would have seen his correspondent in person. On the afternoon of Monday, May
13th, the inhabitants of the town which had given this terrible Claverhouse his title saw to
their amazement the crest of the high ground to the north glittering with steel-clad riders.
At the same time Lord Rollo, who was camped outside the walls with some new levies of horse,
came flying through the gates with the news that Dundee was upon them. The drums beat to arms:
the gates were closed; and barricades hastily thrown up in the principal streets, while the
citizens crowded on the walls to stare at the audacious foe.

It is possible that Dundee, who was ignorant of Creichton's departure, thought that his appearance
might bring the dragoons over to his side at once. But the officer who was then in command
kept his troops quiet; and after manoeuvring his men up to the very walls of the town Dundee
drew off as night fell to Glen Ogilvy.[83] It is impossible that even he can have conceived
the idea of a serious attack on the place; and the story of his actually entering and plundering
the town is certainly apocryphal, though his men very probably made free with Rollo's camp.

Meanwhile Mackay at Inverness was busy in his turn among the clans. Lochiel had only sent the
cross round among those chiefs who, like him, hated the Campbells. Dundee had gone further
afield, but had not been successful. The gratitude of the Mackintoshes was not enough to do
more than keep them neutral,--which was perhaps fortunate, for had they joined the muster at
Lochaber they would inevitably have been at blows with the Macdonalds before a day had passed.
The Macphersons also kept aloof, and the Macleods. Mackay's invitations were received with
the same indifference. Some of the Grants, whose chief had suffered under the late Government
for his allegiance to Argyle, joined him; and from the northern shires of Ross and Sutherland
a few Mackays came to fight for a captain of their own blood. But the two sources on which
the Government had mainly relied for help were both found wanting. The Campbells had suffered
so severely from the invasion of Athole in the previous year that Argyle found it impossible
to rally them in time to be of service in the present campaign. The Covenanters, though hailing
the rule of William as a deliverance from the rule of James, were persuaded by their ministers
that it was a sin to take military service, even against the abhorred Dundee, with men whose
orthodoxy was, to say the least, not above suspicion. Seaforth, Lovat, Breadalbane, and the
other great lords of the east and south Highlands, would not bid their vassals arm for either
side. Athole had indeed once more professed allegiance to the new order, but while affairs
were still in an uncertain state he would not commit himself to any decisive action. It was
clear to Mackay that the name of William was no name to charm with in Scotland, and that the
most he could hope to effect was to prevent a general rising of the clans for James. The sagacious
Tarbat had already pointed out to him how this might be done. Five thousand pounds, he said,
would be ample to satisfy all Argyle's claims upon the chiefs who owed him vassalage. If these
claims were satisfied, and the clans assured that under William they would secure the freedom
they had hoped for from James, though it might not be possible to persuade them to fight for
the former, not a single claymore would follow Dundee to the field for the latter. William
was now induced to try the experiment. But by a blunder so extraordinary as to suggest treachery
somewhere, the agent entrusted to manage the affair was himself a Campbell. The chiefs naturally
refused to listen to such a messenger, and treated all subsequent overtures with a contemptuous
refusal or a still more contemptuous silence. It is not certain that any money was actually
expended; but if so, it is very certain that not a penny of it went to any Cameron or Macdonald.

Dundee had now reached Lochaber, where he was cordially welcomed by Lochiel, and lodged in
a building close to the chief's own house, a rude structure of pine-wood, but in his men's
eyes a magnificent palace. The clans had proved true to their tryst. Every Cameron who could
wield a broadsword was there. From the wild peaks of Corryarrick and Glen Garry, from the dark
passes of Glencoe and the storm-beaten islands of the western seas, the men of Macdonald came
trooping in. Sir John of Duart brought a strong gathering of Macleans from Mull, promising
that more of the name were on the road. Young Stewart of Appin had led his little band from
the shores of Loch Finnhe. The Macnaghtens were there from the very heart of the great enemy's
country, where the hated towers of Inverary cast their shadow on the waters of Loch Fyne. Fraser
of Foyers and Grant of Urquhart, disregarding the action of their respective chiefs, each brought
a small following of his own vassals.

It is impossible to calculate the exact force which, at any time during his short campaign,
Dundee had at his disposal. But the number of claymores which this first muster brought to
Lochaber cannot have been less than two thousand. Besides these, there was his little body
of cavalry, some fifty sabres in all, partly composed of his own troopers, and partly of Dunfermline's
followers. That nobleman and Lord Dunkeld were of the party. Dundee's own brother, too, seems
to have been with him, and a member of the Duntroon branch of the Grahams. Certain gentlemen
from the Lowlands had also joined him: Sir Alexander James of Coxtone, Sir Archibald Kennedy
of Cullean, Hallyburton of Pitcur, Murray of Abercairny, and others.

Still there was no sign from Ireland, and Dundee hesitated to take the field against Mackay
with such capricious and irregular allies. He did not doubt the courage of his Highlanders,
but he had grave doubts of their obedience. That they would fight bravely when it was their
cue to fight, he knew well; but he was much less confident that they would take their cue from
him. He had at first conceived the idea of putting them through some course of military training,
but Lochiel urged so many and such weighty reasons against it that he gave up the plan. "There
is not time," said the sagacious old chief, "for our men to learn your method of warfare. They
would merely unlearn their own. This is one which must seem strange to your notions of war;
but it is one which they thoroughly understand, and which makes them, when led by such a general
as you, a match for the most practised veterans. Think of what they did under Montrose, and
be sure that they will show the same courage and win as great victories under you." It, therefore,
became more than ever necessary that the promised succours should be no longer delayed. Some
regular troops, however few, would serve both as a rallying-point and as an example to the
Highlanders. And, indeed, it had been only on the promise of such support that Lochiel had
induced the chiefs to arm. Dundee sent letter after letter to Ireland full of cheerful accounts
of the good promise of affairs, but urging the instant despatch of troops, together with a
store of money, ammunition, and all the other necessaries for an army about to take the field,
of which there was, in truth, a most plentiful lack in Lochaber. There were not above fifty
pounds of powder in the camp; and though the Highland fashion was to trust more to the cold
steel than the bullet, powder was a necessity of war that could not well be altogether dispensed
with. Dundee also urged upon Melfort the good effect James' own presence would have upon his
Scottish allies. If that could not be managed, he said, at least let him send the Duke of Berwick.
There was no petty jealousy in Dundee's character. He would have cheerfully put himself under
the command of any man if by so doing he were likely to further the cause he had at heart.
But no answer came to these appeals. In one of the last letters Dundee wrote, he reminds Melfort
that for three months he had received not a single line from him or from James.

Meanwhile, his tact, his good temper, courtesy, and liberality had won the hearts of his new
allies. With the money he had brought with him from the Lowlands, and the supplies his wife
and some of his friends were able occasionally to send him, he contrived to maintain an establishment
that was at least superior to anything which most of his new friends were accustomed to. Every
day he entertained some of the chiefs at his table. He made himself acquainted with the faces
and names of the principal tacksmen of each clan, and mastered a few words of Gaelic to enable
him to address and return salutations. In the field he lived no better than the meanest of
his men, sharing their coarse food and hard lodging, and often marching on foot by their side
over the roughest country and in the wildest weather. His powers of endurance extorted the
wonder even of those sturdy mountaineers who had been inured from childhood to the extremes
of hunger and fatigue. More than a century after his death it was still told with admiration
how once, after chasing Mackay from dawn to sunset of a summer's day over the ruggedest part
of the Athole country, he had spent the night in writing, only resting his head occasionally
on his hands to snatch a few moments of sleep. Among the Camerons he was always spoken of as
the General, and honoured next to Lochiel himself. At the same time, he was careful to maintain
his authority and to exact the respect due to his position. He knew well that among those lawless
spirits he who would be obeyed must be feared. On one occasion he administered a public rebuke
to the arch-thief, Keppoch, who had found time for another raid on the Mackintoshes. In the
presence of all the chiefs Dundee told the offender that he would sooner serve in the ranks
of a disciplined regiment than command men who were no better than common robbers; that he
would countenance such outrages no more, nor any longer keep in his army those who disgraced
the King's cause by their private quarrels. Keppoch, who would infallibly have struck his dirk
into any other man who had used such language to him, attempted some lame excuses, muttered
an apology, and ended by promising for the future neither he nor any of his men would stir
a foot save at the General's command. There is no stronger proof of Dundee's genius and capacity
for affairs than the singular influence he was able in a few short weeks to gain over men who
could not speak his language and who hated his race. When on the dark day of Culloden the wavering
clans looked in vain to their Prince, an old chief, who had heard his father talk of Ian Dhu
Cean (Black John, the Warrior), exclaimed in a passion of rage and grief, "Oh, for an hour
of Dundee!"

But loth as he was to engage Mackay with the Highlanders alone, Dundee knew that he could not
hope to keep them long together inactive. Provisions were running short. If they could not
harry James's enemies, they would make free with their own. Dundee was particularly anxious
to give no cause of offence to those clans whose neutrality he hoped to be able to turn into
friendship. Already a serious prospect of disunion had threatened the little army. A party
of the Camerons had made a raid on the Grants, in which a Macdonald of Glengarry had been killed.
The man had become affiliated to the Grants, and had refused to join the muster of his own
tribe. He had therefore forfeited all the right of clanship. Yet Glengarry, as much perhaps
from policy as from any overpowering sense of kinship, demanded vengeance; and it needed all
the combined tact of Dundee and Lochiel to prevent him from drawing out his men to attack the
Camerons. When, therefore, Dundee learned that Mackay had left Inverness to join some reinforcements
from Edinburgh, he determined on action.

The troops Mackay expected to find in Badenoch were six hundred men of his own Scots Brigade
under Colonel Ramsay. Ruthven Castle on the Spey was the place of meeting, and May 26th the
time. But Ramsay had been detained in Edinburgh by an alarm of an invasion from France, and
it was not till the 27th that he entered the Athole country. Here he learned that Dundee was
on the march to meet him. The population did not seem friendly: he could get no news of Mackay;
and on the whole he judged it prudent to retire to Perth. That he might do this with more speed
he blew up his ammunition train, to prevent it falling into Dundee's hands. Mackay, who, as
soon as he learned that Ramsay was fairly on the road, had marched with all speed from Inverness,
was too late to save Ruthven Castle. It had been surrendered by the governor, Captain Forbes,
on the 29th, and reduced to a heap of ruins.

This was the beginning of a series of marches and counter-marches on the part of the two generals,
which lasted far into June, without any advantage on either side. On one occasion a party of
the Macleans of Lochbuy, marching to join Dundee in Badenoch, came to blows with some of Livingstone's
dragoons; and there were other skirmishes, of no material result, at none of which was either
general present in person. More than once Dundee was in striking distance of Mackay; but he
never found himself in a position to engage with sufficient assurance of victory. A defeat
he dared not risk; and even victory, unless complete enough to need no second blow, had its
dangers. An army which considered the safe storage of his booty as the first duty of a successful
soldier could not safely be trusted to make good the result of a doubtful battle. And in fact
he found his forces each day diminishing as food became more scarce in those barren wilds,
or as some lucky raid necessitated a departure for home with the prize. At length, wisely determining
to sanction what he could not prevent, and feeling that even his iron frame and dauntless spirit
were in need of rest, Dundee dismissed the clans for the present, on their giving a promise
to join him again when he should require them. Keeping only some two hundred of the Macleans
with him, he returned to his old quarters, on the pressing invitation of Lochiel, who swore
to him that while there was a cow in Lochaber neither he nor his men should want. Mackay did
not attempt to follow him. At such a game of hide-and-seek he saw that his men were no match
for the active light-marching Highlanders. He accordingly put garrisons into certain fortified
parts of Invernessshire and Perthshire, sent the rest into quarters, and himself repaired to
Edinburgh.

From the middle of June to the end of July the war therefore languished. But Dundee was not
idle. The arts of diplomacy were as familiar to him as the arts of war. He still maintained
an active correspondence with the neutral chiefs, and kept Melfort well informed of all he
had done and proposed to do for his master's service. I shall conclude this chapter with an
extract from the last despatch he sent to Ireland. It is long; but it gives so graphic an account
of his proceedings since the muster at Lochaber, of the state of the country, and the relative
positions and prospects of the two parties, that its length may be excused. It also shows,
what one would not perhaps have otherwise surmised, that the writer had some little touch of
humour. The letter is dated from Moy, in Lochaber, June 27th, 1689. I omit the first part,
which seems to refer to some complaints Melfort had made of his having been ill-spoken of by
Dundee.

     "My Lord, I have given the King, in general, account of
     things here; but to you I will be more particular. As to
     myself, I have sent you it at large. You may by it
     understand a little of the state of the country.[84] You
     will see there, when I had a sure advantage I endeavoured to
     profit on it; but on the other hand, shunned to hazard
     anything for fear of a ruffle. For the least of that would
     have discouraged all. I thought if I could gain time, and
     keep up a figure of a party without loss, it was my best
     till we got assistance, which the enemy got from England
     every day. I have told the King I had neither commission,
     money, nor ammunition. My brother-in-law and my wife found
     ways to get credit.[85] For my own nobody durst pay to a
     traitor. I was extremely surprised when I saw Mr. Drummond,
     the advocate, in Highland habit, come up to Lochaber to me,
     and gave account that the Queen had sent 2,000_l._ sterling
     to London, to be paid to me for the King's service, and that
     two more was a-coming. I did not know the Queen had known
     anything of our affairs. I received a very obliging letter
     from her with Mr. Crane, but I know no way to make a return.
     However, when the money comes, I shall keep count of it and
     employ it right. But I am feared it will be hard to bring it
     from Edinburgh.

     "When we came first out I had but fifty pounds of powder.
     More I could not get. All the great towns and seaports were
     in rebellion, and had seized the powder, and would sell
     none. But I had one advantage--the Highlanders will not fire
     above once, and then take to the broadsword.

     "But I wonder, above all things, that in three months I
     never heard from you, seeing by Mr. Hay I had so earnestly
     recommended it to you, and told of this way by Inverlochy as
     sure. If you could not have sent expresses, we thought you
     would at least have hastened the dispatch of those we sent.
     McSwyne has now been away near two months, and we know not
     if the coast be clear or not. However, I have ventured to
     advise Mr. Hay to return straight, and not go further in the
     country. He came not here until the 22nd, and they
     surrendered on the 13th.[86] It was not Mr. Hay's fault he
     was so long of coming, for there has been two English
     men-of-war and the Glasgow frigates amongst the islands till
     of late. For the rest of the letters I undertook to get them
     delivered. Most of the persons to whom they are directed are
     either put in bond, or in prisons, or gone out of the
     kingdom. The Advocate is gone to England, a very honest man,
     firm beyond belief,[87] and Athole is gone too, who did not
     know what to do. Earl Hume, who is very frank, is taken
     prisoner to Edinburgh, but will be let out on security. Earl
     Breadalbane keeps close in a strong house he has, and
     pretends the gout. Earl Errol stays at home. So does
     Aberdeen. Earl Marischal is at Edinburgh, but does not
     meddle. Earl Lauderdale is right, and at home. The Bishops?
     I know not where they are! They are now the Kirk invisible.
     I will be forced to open the letter, and send copies
     attested to them, and keep the original till I can find out
     our Primate. The poor ministers are sorely oppressed over
     all. They generally stand right. Duke Queensberry was present
     at the Cross when their new mock king was proclaimed, and, I
     hear, voted for him, though not for the throne vacant. His
     brother, the Lieutenant-General, some say is made an earl.
     He is come down to Edinburgh, and is gone up again. He is
     the old man, and has abused [deceived] me strangely. For he
     swore to me to make amends. Tarbat is a great villain.
     Besides what he has done at Edinburgh, he has endeavoured to
     seduce Lochiel by offers of money which is under his hand.
     He is now gone up to secure his faction (which is melting),
     the two Dalrymples and others, against Skelmorly, Polwart,
     Cardross, Ross, and others, now joined with that worthy
     prince, Duke Hamilton. Marquis Douglas is now a great knave,
     as well as beast, as is Glencairn, Morton, and Eglinton.
     And even Cassilis is gone astray, misled by Gibby.[88]
     Panmure keeps right and at home. So does Strathmore,
     Southesk, and Kinnaird. Old Airlie is at Edinburgh under
     caution. So is Balcarres and Dunmore. Stormont is declared
     fugitive for not appearing. All these will break out, and
     many more, when the King lands, or any from him. Most of the
     gentry on this side the Forth, and many on the other, will
     do so too. But they suffer mightily in the meantime, and
     will be forced to submit if there be not relief sent very
     soon. The Duke of Gordon, they say, wanted nothing for
     holding out but hopes of relief. Earl of Dunfermline stays
     constantly with me, and so does Dunkeld, Pitcur, and many
     other gentlemen, who really deserve well, for they suffer
     great hardships. When the troops land, there must be blank
     commissions sent for horse and foot for them, and others
     that will join. There must be a Commission of Justiciary, to
     judge all but landed men. For there should be examples made
     of some who cannot be judged by a council of war. They take
     our people, and hang them up, by their new sheriffs, when
     they find them straggling.[89]

     "My Lord, I have given my opinion to the King concerning the
     landing. I would first have a good party sent over to
     Inverlochy; about five or six thousand, as you have
     convenience of boats; of which as many horse as conveniently
     can. About six or eight hundred would do well, but rather
     more. For had I had horse, for all that yet appeared I would
     not have feared them. Inverlochy is safe landing, far from
     the enemy, and one may choose, from thence, to go to Moray
     by Inverness, or to Angus by Athole, or to Perth by Glencoe,
     and all tolerable ways. The only ill is the passage is long
     by sea, and inconvenient because of the island; but in this
     season that is not to be feared. So soon as the boats
     return, let them ferry over as many more foot as they think
     fit to the point of Kintyre, which will soon be done; and
     then the King has all the boats for his own landing. I
     should march towards Kintyre, and meet, at the neck of
     Tarbet, the foot, and so march to raise the country, and
     then towards the passes of Forth to meet the King, where I
     doubt not but we would be numerous.

     "I have done all I can to make them believe the King will
     land altogether in the west, on purpose to draw their troops
     from the north, that we may easier raise the country if the
     landing be here. I have said so, and written it to
     everybody; and particularly I sent some proclamations to my
     Lady Errol, and wrote to her to that purpose, which was
     intercepted and carried to Edinburgh, and my Lady taken
     prisoner. I believe it has taken the effect I designed; for
     the forces are marched out of Kintyre, and I am just now
     informed Major-General Mackay is gone from Inverness by
     Moray, towards Edinburgh. I know not what troops he has
     taken with him as yet; but it is thought he will take the
     horse and dragoons (except a few) and most of the standing
     forces; which, if he do, it will be a rare occasion for
     landing here, and for raising the country. Then, when they
     hear of that, they will draw this way, which will again
     favour the King's landing. Some think Ely a convenient place
     for landing, because you have choice of what side, and the
     enemy cannot be on both. Others think the nearer Galloway
     the better, because the rebels will have far to march before
     they can trouble you. Others think Kirkcudbright or
     thereabouts, because of that sea for ships, and that it is
     near England. Nobody expects any landing here now, because
     it is thought you will alter the design, it having been
     discovered. And to friends and all I give out I do not
     expect any.

     "So I am extremely of opinion this would be an extreme
     proper place, unless you be so strong that you need not care
     where to land. The truth is, I do not admire their mettle.
     The landing of troops will confound them terribly. I had
     almost forgot to tell you that the Prince of Orange, as they
     say, has written to his Scotch Council, telling them he will
     not have his troops any more harassed following me through
     the hills, but orders them to draw to the West, where, he
     says, a great army is to land; and, at the same time, gives
     them accounts that eight sail of men-of-war is coming from
     Brest, with fifteen thousand men on board. He knows not
     whether they are designed for England or Ireland. I beg you
     will send an express before, whatever you do, that I may
     know how to take my measures; and if the express that comes
     knows nothing, I am sure it shall not be discovered for me.
     I have told Mr. Hay nothing of this proposal, nor no man. If
     there come any party this way, I beg you send me ammunition,
     and three or four thousand arms of different sorts--some
     horse, some foot.

     "I have just now received a confirmation of Mackay's going
     south, and that he takes with him all the horse and
     dragoons, and all the standing foot. By which I conclude,
     certainly, they are preparing against the landing in the
     west. I entreat to hear from you as soon as possible; and
     am, in the old manner, most sincerely, for all Carleton can
     say, my lord, your most humble and faithful servant,

     "DUNDEE."

It appears by a postscript added on the following day, that before Dundee's messenger left
Lochaber letters had arrived from Melfort. They seem to have been again full of complaints
of the hard things said about him, and of the undeserved dislike with which all classes in
Scotland seemed to regard him. But of help there was no more than the usual vague promises,
and glowing accounts of apocryphal successes in Ireland. Dundee congratulated the Secretary
on their master's good fortune, diplomatically fenced with the question of unpopularity, and
reiterated his appeal for succour.

     "For the number" [he wrote], "I must leave [that] to the
     conveniency you have. The only inconveniency of the delay
     is, that the honest suffer extremely in the low country in
     the time, and I dare not go down for want of horse; and, in
     part, for fear of plundering all, and so making enemies,
     having no pay. I wonder you send no ammunition, were it but
     four or five barrels. For we have not twenty pounds."

at this time, will be familiar to every reader. What may be less familiar is a pamphlet entitled

[81] Napier (iii. 552, note) quotes the following minute in the records of the Estates:--"13th
May, 1689: A missive letter from the Viscount of Stormont to the President was read, bearing
that the Viscount Dundee had forced his dinner from him at his house of Scone, on Saturday
last, and therefore desiring that his intercommuning with him, being involuntary, might be
excused." He was cited, however as a delinquent, together with his father-in-law, Scott of
Scotstarvet and his uncle, Sir John Murray of Drumcairn (a Lord of Session), who had also to
assist at the involuntary banquet. Throughout his short campaign Dundee was careful never to
take a penny from the pocket of any private person. He considered, he said, that he was justified
in appropriating the King's money to the King's use.

[82] Creichton calls him Lord Kilsyth, but he had not then succeeded to the title. He is the
same who afterwards married Lady Dundee.

[83] It is doubtful who this officer was. Mackay, in his memoirs, says it was William Livingstone,
calling him either a coward or a traitor for not showing fight. If Livingstone it was, he may
not have felt sure enough of the men who were left with him to join Dundee in so open a manner,
and to fight was not his cue. But another account puts one Captain Balfour in command. The
whole account of the affair is even more confused than are most of Dundee's exploits. But that
he did make a demonstration of some sort against the town is proved by the Minutes of the Estates.

CHAPTER XI.

Mackay had now decided on a new plan of campaign. He would apply to the service of war a device
employed by the Highlanders in the chase, and put in practice against them their own tactics
of the tinchel.[90] A chain of fortified posts was to be established among the Grampians, and
at various commanding points in Invernessshire. On the west a strong garrison was to be placed
in the castle of Inverlochy, the northernmost point of Argyle's country overlooking the stronghold
of the Camerons. A small fleet of armed frigates drawing a light draft was to cruise off the
western coasts, and to watch those dangerous islands whence issued the long war-galleys of
the Macdonalds and the Macleans. Stores and transport enough to keep a considerable force in
the field for one month was to be collected; and a skilled body of pioneers, equipped with
all the tools necessary for road-making, was to accompany the column.

Having already sketched out this plan in a letter to Hamilton, Mackay was in hopes to find
on his arrival in Edinburgh that measures had been begun to put it into operation. He was grievously
disappointed. He found nothing but quarrels and intrigues in the Parliament House and out of
it. Each man was too intent on out-manoeuvring his neighbour in the great struggle for place,
to spare a thought for a foe who was happily separated from them by a vast barrier of mountains
and many hundreds of miles of barren moorland, deep waters, and dense forests. He saw that
his plan for subduing the warriors of the Highlands must wait till the Lowland politicians
were at leisure to listen to him; yet he determined to return to his duty, and to do his best
with such means as he could find or make for himself. It was possible that Argyle might now
have sufficiently repaired his affairs to be able to render some assistance from the West;
and there was an ally in Perthshire who might, if he would, prove of even more value than Argyle.[91]

Lord Murray, Athole's eldest son, had, unlike his father, made up his mind early in the Revolution
and kept to it. But it happened that there was one now in possession of Blair Castle who had
also chosen his side with equal resolution. Athole had slunk off to England, leaving his castle
and his vassals to the charge of his agent, Stewart of Ballechin. Ballechin was a sturdy Jacobite;
and though he had not yet dared to arm the Athole men for James, he had managed on more than
one occasion to do timely service to Dundee. Blair was one of the most important posts in the
proposed line of garrisons. It commanded on one side the only road by which troops could march
from the low country of Perth into the Highlands, and on the other the passes leading to the
Spey and the Dee. Whoever held Blair practically held the key of the Highlands. Mackay therefore
urged Murray, who was then in Edinburgh, to get rid of this unjust steward and make sure of
so valuable a stronghold for the Government. Murray promised to do what he could. He did not
profess to be very sanguine of persuading the men of Athole to fight for William; but for the
castle, he could not suppose that Ballechin would dare to shut the gates of his own father's
house against him. "Keep the Athole men from joining Dundee," said Mackay, "and that is all
I ask, or can expect from your father's son." He pressed Murray to start at once for Blair,
promising to follow as soon as he could collect the necessary force of troops and stores.

It was tedious work preparing for a campaign in Edinburgh, where, nobody feeling himself in
immediate danger, nobody was concerned to guard against it. Mackay was detained longer than
he had expected, and before he could take the field bad news had come down from Perthshire.
Ballechin was strongly entrenched in Blair, and resolute not to budge an inch. The Athole men
had gathered readily enough to their young lord's summons; but when they found he had summoned
them to fight for King William they had gone off in a body shouting for King James.[92] And
there was yet worse news. The fiery cross was speeding once more through the Western Highlands.
There could be no doubt that Ballechin was acting under orders from Dundee. A few men had stayed
with Murray, and with these he proposed to watch the castle and the pass till Mackay should
come. But the clans were mustering fast. Dundee himself was said to be in the neighbourhood.
Unless troops could be brought up at once, Blair would be irretrievably lost, and the key of
the Highlands in the hands of Dundee.

Dundee was in the neighbourhood. He was at Struan, close to Blair, whence he wrote more than
one letter to Murray, using every argument he could think likely to influence the interests
or the prejudices of Athole's son. Professing to be convinced that Murray was really for James,
though doubtful about the time for declaring himself, he declared that he had only sent help
to Ballechin to keep the rebels at bay till Murray was able to act as his principles and education
would naturally suggest. The King, he said, had seen the mistakes into which Melfort had hurried
him. He had now given his word to secure the Protestant religion as by law established, to
allow full liberty of conscience to all dissenters, and to grant a general pardon for all except
those who had been actively engaged in dethroning him. What more might be necessary to satisfy
the people, Dundee begged Murray to let him know. The King was particularly anxious for advice
on these points, and ready to go all reasonable lengths; and Murray, he well knew, would advise
nothing unreasonable. No more was to be feared from Melfort, who had promised to forgive all
old quarrels, and even to resign his office rather than force himself upon those who were unwilling
to receive him. Finally (keeping to the last the most powerful argument he could devise), he
declared that it was now in Murray's power to "have the honour of the whole turn of the King's
affairs." Murray would make no answer, refused to see Dundee's messengers, and sent all his
letters on to Mackay.[93]

Dundee knew the importance of Blair as well as Mackay. As soon as he heard from Ballechin of
Murray's action, he threw a garrison into the castle, and sent signal to the clans to join
him at once. The time was short: too short even to muster all the outlying Camerons. Some days
must elapse before he could expect to see round him such a force as he had commanded two months
earlier, and every hour was precious. Lochiel urged him to march at once for Blair with such
forces as were at hand, promising to follow with the rest. But Dundee was loth to advance without
Lochiel. He relied much on the old chief's sagacity and experience, on his knowledge of the
Highland character, and his tact in managing it: without his counsel and support he did not
feel even now certain of his quarrelsome captains. He prayed Lochiel, therefore, to come with
him, leaving his son to bring on the late musters.

As they marched through Badenoch they were joined by the long-promised succours from Ireland--three
hundred ragged Irish recruits, half starved, badly armed, and entirely ignorant of war. Their
leader was an officer named Cannon, who bore a commission from James giving him rank next to
Dundee, a position which neither his abilities nor his experience entitled him to hold in such
an army. Some stores of powder and food had been sent with them; but the vessels containing
them had, through Cannon's negligence, been taken in the Hebrides by English cruisers. Dundee
had neither powder nor food to spare. There had been no time to collect provisions; and for
many days past his officers had eaten no bread and drunk nothing but water. The great promises
of help on which the Highlanders had so confidently relied, on the assurance of which they
had taken the field, and for which their general had repeatedly given his own word, had shrunk
to this--three hundred empty mouths to feed, and three hundred useless hands to arm.[94]

And now word came that Mackay was approaching. He had marched by way of Stirling to Perth,
at which place he had appointed his muster. At Stirling he had found six troops of dragoons,
which he had ordered to follow him to Perth. On July 26th he was at Dunkeld, where he received
word from Murray of Dundee's arrival at Blair, but not the dragoons he was expecting from Stirling.
His own cavalry consisted of but two troops, chiefly composed of new levies. He dared no longer
trust Livingstone's dragoons in the face of the enemy. Half of the officers he had been obliged
to send under guard to Edinburgh as traitors: the rest of the regiment was out of harm's way
in quarters at Inverness. The horses of Colchester's men were in such a plight after their
marches among the Grampians that they could not carry a saddle. Mackay knew well how important
cavalry was to the work before him. A mounted soldier was the one antagonist a Highlander feared;
and his fear was much the same superstitious awe that a century and a half earlier the hordes
of Montezuma had felt for the armoured horsemen of Cortez. But the messages from Murray were
urgent, and he dared not delay. At break of day on Saturday, the 27th, he marched out from
Dunkeld for the glen of Killiecrankie.

His force, according to his own calculation, was between three and four thousand strong; but
barely one half of these were seasoned troops. There was the Scots Brigade, indeed, of three
regiments, his own, Balfour's, and Ramsay's. But before despatching them to Scotland William
had ordered them to be carefully weeded of all Dutch soldiers, that the patriotism of the natives
might be offended by no hint of a foreign invasion; and the gaps thus made had been hastily
filled up in Edinburgh. Besides this brigade were three other regiments of infantry: the one
lately raised by Lord Leven (now the Twenty-fifth of the Line, and still recognizing its origin
in its title of The Borderers), Hastings' (now the Thirteenth of the Line), and Lord Kenmure's.[95]
Of these, Hastings' was manned chiefly by Englishmen, and seems to have been the only one of
the three that had had any real experience of war. One troop of horse was commanded by Lord
Belhaven: the other should have been commanded by Lord Annandale, whose name it bore, but Mackay
could persuade neither him nor Lord Ross to take the field. Some feeling of compunction may
have kept the latter from drawing his sword against an old comrade in arms; but Lord Annandale
had always been fonder of wrangling than fighting. Mackay makes no mention of any artillery;
but it appears that he had a few small field-pieces of the kind known as Sandy's Stoups from
the name of their inventor.[96]

It is only possible to guess at Dundee's numbers. When he broke up his army early in June he
seems to have had about three thousand claymores under him. The second muster was, we know,
much smaller than the first; and though it was slightly increased on the march, and while he
waited at Blair, the whole force he led at Killiecrankie cannot have much exceeded two thousand
men. Over and above the claymores he had not four hundred. The Irish were three hundred, and
his cavalry mustered about fifty sabres. Highland tradition puts the claymores at nineteen
hundred; and this is probably much about the truth. Artillery, of course, he had none.

As soon as it was known that Mackay was at the mouth of the pass, Dundee called a council of
war. Three courses, he told his officers, were before them: to harass Mackay's advance with
frequent skirmishes, avoiding a general engagement till the reinforcements a few days would
certainly bring had made the numbers more equal: to attack him in the pass; or to wait till
he had reached the level ground above it. His own officers, and the Lowland gentlemen generally,
were in favour of the first plan. Some of the chiefs were in favour of the second. Dundee listened
courteously to all, and then turned to the old chief of the Camerons who had not yet spoken.
What, he asked, did Lochiel advise? Lochiel had no doubt. They must fight and fight at once,
were the enemy three to one. Their men were in heart: they would have all the advantage of
the ground: let Mackay get fairly through the pass that the Highlanders might see their foes,
and then charge home. He had no fear for the result; but he would answer for nothing were the
claymores to be kept back now the Saxons were fairly at their feet.

Those who watched Dundee saw his eye brighten. He answered that he agreed with every word Lochiel
had spoken. Delay would bring reinforcements to Mackay as well as to them, and Mackay's reinforcements
would almost certainly include more cavalry. To fight them in the pass was useless. In that
narrow way the weight of the Highland onset would be lost. The claymores would not have room
for their work, and half the column would escape. They must fight on open ground and on fair
terms, as Montrose would have fought.[97]

There was no more opposition. The word for battle went through the clans, and was hailed with
universal delight. Then Lochiel spoke again. He had always, he said, promised implicit obedience
to Dundee, and he had kept his promise; but for once he should command. "It is the voice of
your Council," he went on, "and their orders are that you do not engage personally. Your Lordship's
business is to have an eye on all parts, and to issue out your commands as you shall think
proper. It is ours to execute them with promptitude and courage. On you depends the fate not
only of this little brave army, but also of our King and country." He finished by threatening
that neither he nor any of his clan should draw sword that day unless his request were granted.
Dundee answered that he knew his life to be at that moment of some importance, but he could
not on that day of all days refuse to hazard it. The Highlanders would never again obey in
council a general whom they thought afraid to lead them in war. Hereafter he would do as Lochiel
advised, but he must charge at the head of his men in their first battle. "Give me," he concluded,
"one _Shear-Darg_ (harvest-day's work) for the King, my master, that I may show the brave clans
that I can hazard my life in that service as freely as the meanest of them."[98]

Mackay had reached the mouth of the pass at ten in the morning. Here he found Murray and his
little band, who had not judged it prudent to remain longer in the neighbourhood of Blair.
Two hundred picked men were accordingly sent forward to reconnoitre under Colonel Lauder; and
at noon, the ground having been reported clear in front, the whole column advanced.

The pass of Killiecrankie is now almost as familiar to the Southron as to the Highlander. It
forms the highest and narrowest part of a magnificent wooded defile in which the waters of
the Tummel flowing eastward from Loch Rannoch meet the waters of the Garry as it plunges down
from the Grampians. Along one of the best roads in the kingdom, or by the swift and comfortable
service of the Highland railway, the traveller ascends by easy gradations from Pitlochrie,
through the beautiful grounds of Faskally to the little village and station of Killiecrankie,
where a guide earns an unlaborious livelihood by conducting the panting Saxon over the famous
battle-field and to various commanding points of the defile. How the scene must have looked
in those days, and what thoughts it must have suggested to men either ignorant of war or accustomed
to pursue it in civilised countries, has been described by Macaulay in a passage which it were
superfluous to quote and impertinent to paraphrase. Near sixty years later, when some Hessian
troops were marching to the relief of Blair Castle, then besieged by the forces of Prince Charles,
the stolid Germans turned from the desperate sight and, vowing that they had reached the limits
of the world, marched resolutely back to Perth. The only road that then led through this Valley
of the Shadow of Death was a rugged path, so narrow that not more than three men could walk
abreast, winding along the edge of a precipitous cliff at the foot of which thundered the black
waters of the Garry. Balfour's regiment led the van of this perilous march: the baggage was
in the centre, guarded by Mackay's own battalion: Annandale's horse and Hastings' foot brought
up the rear.

For about the last mile and a half the pass runs due north and south; but at the summit the
river bends westward, and the mountains sweep back to the right. As the head of the column
emerged into open air it found itself on a small table-land, flanked on the left by the Garry,
and on the right by a tier of low hills sparely dotted with dwarf trees and underwood. Above
these hills to the north and east rose the lofty chain of the Grampians crowned by the towering
peaks of Ben Gloe and Ben Vrackie. In front the valley gradually opened out towards Blair Castle,
about three miles distant, and along this valley Mackay naturally looked for the Highland advance.
He sent some pioneers forward to entrench his position, and as each regiment came up on to
the level ground, he formed it in line three deep. Balfour's regiment thus made the left wing
resting on the Garry, while Hastings was on the right where the ground began to slope upwards
to the hills. Next to Balfour stood Ramsay's men, and then Kenmure's, Leven's, and the general's
own regiment. The guns were in the centre, and the two troops of horse in the rear of the guns.

In the meantime Dundee had not been idle. Sending a few men straight down the valley, he led
his main body across the Tilt, which joins the Garry just below the castle, round at the back
of the hills till he had reached the English right. Mackay was in front with his skirmishers,
watching what he supposed to be the approach of Dundee's van, when word was brought to him
that the enemy were occupying the hills on the right in force. Mackay saw his danger at a glance.
The Highlanders would be down like one of their own rivers in flood on his right flank, and
roll the whole line up into the Garry. On one of the hills overlooking his position stood what
is now known as Urrard House, but was then called by its proper name of Renrorie.[99] Immediately
below this stretched a piece of ground large and level enough in Mackay's judgment for his
army to receive, though not to give, the attack. He made no change in his line, but wheeling
it as it stood upon the right wing, he marched it up the slope on to this new ground in the
face of the enemy.[100] His position was now better than it had been; but it was bad enough.
The river was in his rear, and behind the river the inhospitable mountains. His only way of
escape, should the day go against him, lay through that terrible pass up which, with no enemy
to harass him, he had just climbed with infinite toil. He could hardly hope to make good his
retreat down such a road with a victorious army maddening in his rear. In the preliminary game
of tactics he had been completely out-manoeuvred by his old comrade.

The clans were now forming for battle. The Macleans of Duart held the post of honour on the
right wing. Next to the Macleans stood Cannon with his Irish. Then came the men of Clanranald,
the men of Glengarry, and the Camerons. The left wing was composed of the Macdonalds of Sleat
and some more Macleans. In the centre was the cavalry, commanded not as hitherto by the gallant
Dunfermline, but by a gentleman bearing the illustrious name of Wallace. He had crossed from
Ireland with Cannon; but nothing is heard of him till apparently on the very morning of the
day he produced a commission from James superseding the Earl of Dunfermline in favour of Sir
William Wallace of Craigie. What would otherwise appear one of those inexplicable freaks by
which James ever delighted to confound his affairs at their crisis, is amply explained by the
fact that the new captain was the brother of Melfort's second wife. Fortunately Dunfermline
was too good a soldier and too loyal a gentleman to resent the slight. As Mackay's line was
much longer than his, Dundee was compelled to widen the spaces between the clans for fear of
being outflanked, which left for his centre only this little cluster of sabres. Lochiel's eldest
son, John, was with his father, but Allan, the second, held a commission in Mackay's own regiment.
As the general saw each clan take up its ground, he turned to young Cameron and said, pointing
to the standard of Lochiel, "There is your father with his wild savages; how would you like
to be with him?" "It signifies little what I would like," was the spirited answer; "but I recommend
you to be prepared, or perhaps my father and his wild savages may be nearer to you before night
than you would like!"[101]

Each general spoke a few words to his men. Dundee reminded his captains that they were assembled
that day to fight in the best of causes, in the cause of their King, their religion and their
country, against rebels and usurpers. He urged them to behave like true Scotchmen, and to redeem
their country from the disgrace cast on it by the treachery and cowardice of others. He asked
nothing of them but what they should see him do before them all. Those who fell would fall
honourably like true and brave soldiers: those who lived and conquered would have the reward
of a gracious King and the praise of all good men. Let them charge home then, in the name of
King James and the Church of Scotland. Mackay urged the same honourable duty on his battalions;
but he added one very practical consideration which suggests that he was not so confident of
the issue as he afterwards professes to have been, and which was perhaps not very wisely offered.
They must fight, he said, for they could not fly. The enemy was much quicker afoot than they,
and there were the Athole men waiting to pounce on all runaways. Such thoughts would hardly
furnish the best tonic to a doubtful spirit. Nevertheless the troops answered cheerfully that
they would stand by their general to the last; which, adds the brave old fellow ruefully in
his despatch, "most of them belied shortly after."[102]

A dropping fire of musketry had for some time been maintained between the two lines, and on
the English left there had been some closer skirmishing between Lauder's sharpshooters and
the Macleans. Mackay was anxious to engage before the sun set. He doubted how his raw troops
would stand a night-attack from a foe to whom night and day were one: still more did he fear
what might happen in the darkness during the confusion of a retreat down that awful pass. But
he could not attack, and Dundee would not, till his moment came. The darkness the other feared
would be all in his favour. A very short time he knew would be enough to decide the issue of
the battle. Should that issue be favourable to King James, as he felt confident it would be,
he had determined that before the next morning dawned there should be no army left to King
William in the Highlands.

The sun set, and the moment he had chosen came. The Southrons saw Dundee, who had now changed
his scarlet coat for one of less conspicuous colour, ride along the line, and as he passed
each clan they saw plaids and brogues flung off. They heard the shout with which the word to
advance was hailed; but the cheer they sent back did not carry with it the conviction of victory.
Lochiel turned to his Camerons with a smile. "Courage!" he said, "the day is our own. I am
the oldest commander in this army; and I tell you that feeble noise is the cry of men who are
doomed to fall by our hands this night." Then the old warrior flung off his shoes with the
rest of them, and took his place at the head of his men. Dundee rode to the front of his cavalry.
The pipes sounded, and the clans came down the hill.

They advanced slowly at first, without firing a shot, while Mackay's right poured a hot volley
into their ranks, and the leathern cannon discharged their harmless thunder from the centre.
A gentleman of the Grants, who was fighting that day among the Macdonalds, was knocked over
by a spent ball which struck his target. "Sure, the Boddachs are in earnest now!" he said,
as he leaped to his feet with a laugh. It was not till they had reached the level ground that
the Highlanders delivered their fire. One volley they poured in, and then, flinging their muskets
away, bounded forward sword in hand with a terrific yell. The soldiers had not time to fix
their bayonets in the smoking muzzles of their muskets before the claymores were among them
and the battle was over.[103] On the left wing scarcely a trigger was pulled: the men broke
and ran like sheep. The famous Scots Brigade, in fact, set the example of flight. Their officers
behaved like brave soldiers. Balfour, abandoned by his men, defended himself for a time against
overwhelming odds, till he was cut down by a young clergyman, Robert Stewart, a grandson of
Ballechin. Eight officers of Mackay's own regiment were killed, including his brother, the
colonel; and many of Ramsay's. In vain was the cavalry ordered to charge. In vain did Belhaven
like a gallant gentleman gallop to the front. In vain did Mackay place himself at their head,
and, calling on them to follow him, spur into the thick of the flashing claymores. Before his
horse they fell back right and left in such a way as to justify his boast to Melville that
with fifty stout troopers he could have changed the day even then; but one of his own servants
alone followed him. A few of the dragoons discharged their carbines at random. Then all turned
and spurred off among the crowd of footmen to the mouth of the pass. Some of the fugitives
tried to cross the Garry, and were either drowned in its swift waters, or cut down as they
scrambled drenched and unarmed through its fords. Down the pass to Pitlochrie the rout went.
The men of Athole, no longer doubtful of the issue, pounced from their lair upon the easy prey;
and even women lent their hands to the butchery.[104]

Well might Mackay bitterly complain, "There was no regiment or troop with me but behaved like
the vilest cowards in nature except Hastings and my Lord Leven's."[105] For on the right matters
had fared rather better with the Lowlanders. Many of Leven's Borderers had stood firm and Hastings'
Englishmen; and where the Southrons stood firm the Highlanders wavered. But they were too few
for Mackay to have any hopes of retrieving the fortune of the day. The Highlanders were now
busy with the baggage, which offered a more tempting and less troublesome prize than the struggling
mass of fugitives. Mackay therefore collected the few men he could get together, and led them
across the Garry by a ford above the field of battle over the mountains towards Stirling. On
his march he overtook some more of his runaways whom Ramsay was leading in the same direction.
Mackay did all it was possible for a brave man to do to encourage his men and keep them together.
But many were too frightened to heed his words, or even the pistol with which he threatened
to shoot the first man he saw leaving his ranks. The news of his defeat had spread with marvellous
rapidity: the whole country was up: every glen and mountain sent out its reapers to the rich
harvest. And where enemies did not exist, the fears of these poor wretches found them. Every
drover with his herd, every shepherd with his flock, was magnified into a fresh array of the
terrible Highlanders. On the evening of Monday, the 29th, Mackay reached Stirling with barely
one-fifth of the force with which he had marched out of the town a week earlier.

The Highland loss was calculated at nine hundred men. The Macdonalds and Camerons were the
principal sufferers, their position on the left and left-centre having brought them in contact
with the battalions who had kept their ground. Glengarry's brother was among the killed, with
Macdonald of Largo, and no less than five cousins of Macdonald of the Isles. Among the Lowlanders
fell Hallyburton of Pitcur, and Gilbert Ramsay, Dundee's favourite officer, who had dreamed
overnight of the victory and of his death. But though the battle had been won for James, he
had suffered a greater loss than William. A fresh army could replace Mackay's broken battalions;
but no one could replace Dundee, and Dundee was dead.

He had ridden at the head of his cavalry straight on Mackay's centre. But for some unexplained
reason his troopers had not followed him close; whether their new captain did not like the
guns, or had misunderstood his orders, is not clear. Dunfermline, seeing his general's plumed
hat waving above the smoke, had spurred out of the ranks with sixteen gentlemen, and with these
sabres the guns were taken and silenced. Dundee, seeing that all went well on the right wing,
turned to the left where the Macdonalds were wavering before the firmer front of Hastings'
Englishmen. As he galloped across the field to bring them to the charge, a shot struck him
in the right side immediately below his breastplate. For a few strides further he clung swaying
to his saddle, and then sank from his horse into the arms of a soldier named Johnstone. Like
Wolfe on the heights of Abraham, he asked how the day went. "Well for the King," said the man,
"but I am sorry for your Lordship." And like Wolfe, Dundee answered, "It is the less matter
for me, seeing the day goes well for my master." As his officers returned from the pursuit
they found him on the field, and it is said, though one would be glad to disbelieve it, stripped
by the very men whom he had led to victory. By his side was found a bundle of papers. Among
them was a letter from Melfort, bidding him be sure that both he and James would feel themselves
bound by no promise of toleration circumstances had induced them to make. Well might Balcarres,
who knew his friend's disposition better than Melfort, tell James how such foolish and disingenuous
dealing had grieved Dundee and all who wished honestly to the cause.[106]

Dundee's body, wrapped in a plaid, was carried to the castle, and a few days later buried in
the old church of Blair. In 1852 some bones, believed to be his, were removed from Blair to
the Church of Saint Drostan in the parish of Old Deer, in Aberdeenshire; and eleven years later
a window of stained glass was placed in the same church, bearing, on a brass plate in the window-sill,
this inscription: "Sacred to the memory of John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee, who
died in the arms of victory, and whose battle-cry was 'King James and the Church of Scotland!'"

As no stone was ever known to mark his first grave; there is, of course, ample room for the
incredulous to smile over this late tribute to his memory. But in truth the shadow of doubt
broods over him in death as in life. It is certain only that he received his death-wound on
the field of battle, and in the moment of victory. What else fell with him there was well expressed
by William. When the news from Killiecrankie came down, the King was urged at once to send
a large army into the Highlands. "It is needless," he answered, "the war ended with Dundee's life."

FOOTNOTES:

    "We'll quell the savage mountaineer,
      As their tinchel cows the game."

The tinchel was the name given to the circle of hunters which, gradually narrowing, hemmed
the deer into a small space, where they could be easily slaughtered.

[91] Mackay complains bitterly in his Memoirs of "the unconcerned method of the Government
in matters which touch them nearest as to their general safety, each being for his particular,
and fixed upon his private projects, so as neither to see nor be concerned for anything else."

[92] "When in front of Blair Castle their real destination was disclosed to them by Lord Tullibardine
[the heir of Athole did not assume this style till 1695]. Instantly they rushed from their
ranks, ran to the adjoining stream of Banovy, and, filling their bonnets with water, drank
to the health of King James; and then, with colours flying and pipes playing, 'fifteen hundred
of the men of Athole, as reputable for arms as any in the kingdom' [Mackay's words], put themselves
under the command of the Laird of Ballechin and marched off to join Lord Dundee." Stewart's
"Sketches of the Highlanders of Scotland," i. 67. But this is not strictly true. They joined
neither Ballechin nor Dundee, but went off on their own account to the mountains to watch the
issue of events.

[93] Probably Dundee wrote more confidently than he felt. He owned that Murray might "have
more to do to believe" Melfort's assurance than James's; but, in fact, there was too good reason
to disbelieve both. From the first letter written from Struan it appears that the despatch
from James which had fallen into Hamilton's hands was much more temperate and conciliatory
than the earlier one brought to the Convention by Crane. Dundee had not seen this despatch;
and it is possible that he described it rather as his own good sense urged him to believe it
must have been, than as it really was. The letters to himself, which he summarises for Murray's
benefit, must have been those acknowledged in the postscript to Melfort of June 28th. It is,
as we shall presently see, certain that about this time James was induced to assume, as he
had before assumed when it was too late, the virtue of toleration. How much of these promises
Dundee really believed, it is impossible to say. The history of our own time has shown, and
is every day showing, that neither wisdom nor experience will always avail to prevent a man
from believing that which it is his interest to believe.

[94] Memoirs of Balcarres and of Lochiel.

[95] I have given the modern style of these regiments as they were before the last freak of
the War Office. What they may be now, I do not know; nor is the knowledge important, for the
style I have used will probably be most familiar to my readers. "My Uncle Toby," it will be
remembered, was of Leven's regiment. There exists a letter from Schomberg to Lord Leven, especially
commending to the latter's care a gentleman of the name of Le Fevre. See the "Leven and Melville
Papers."

[96] Mackay says in his Memoirs that he left Edinburgh with two troops of horse, and four of
dragoons. It is certain that only the former were engaged at Killiecrankie. But the general's
narrative is throughout extremely confused, and sometimes barely intelligible. Perhaps the
larger force was that he had counted on having; or the four troops of dragoons may have been
those he ordered to follow from Stirling.

Alexander Hamilton, who commanded the artillery in the Covenanter's army with which Leslie
and Montrose made the famous passage of the Tyne in 1640. From Burton's description of them
they can hardly have been very dangerous, at least to the enemy. "They seem to have been made
of tin for the bore, with a coating of leather, all secured by tight cordage. A horse could
carry two of them, and it was their merit to stand a few discharges before they came to pieces."
"History of Scotland," vi. 302.

[97] It is said that one of Dundee's arguments against attacking in the pass was, that it did
not become brave soldiers to engage a foe at disadvantage, an argument which I should imagine
Dundee was much too sensible a man to employ to Highlanders. Had his force been sufficient
for him to close up the mouth of the pass after the Lowlanders had entered, it is hard to imagine
he would have lost the chance of catching Mackay in such a trap. But his force was too small
to divide: while the nature of the ground would of course have told as much against those who
made as against those who met a charge, besides inevitably offending the jealous point of honour
which forbad one clan to take precedence of another. It may be, too, that Dundee was not very
well served by his scouts. Mackay certainly seems to have got well on his way through the pass
before the other knew that he had entered it. See the "Life of Mackay," and the "Rebellions
in Scotland."

[98] Memoirs of Lochiel.

[99] For long afterwards the battle was known among the Highlanders as the battle of Renrorie.

[100] Mackay's Memoirs: "a quart de conversion" is his own phrase for this change of front.

[101] "Sketches of the Highlanders."

[102] Among the Nairne Papers is what purports to be a copy of Dundee's speech. It has been
contemptuously rejected by some writers as a manifest forgery, on the ground that no Highlander
would have understood a word of it. But there were Dundee's own officers and men to be addressed;
and, moreover, his language would have been perfectly intelligible to some, at least, of the
chiefs, who would have conveyed its purpose to their men. It was still the fashion for a general
to harangue his troops before leading them into action, and it was a fashion particularly in
vogue among the Highlanders. I see no reason, therefore, to doubt the general authenticity
of this speech. Exactly as it stands in the Nairne Papers probably Dundee did not deliver it;
the style being somewhat more grandiloquent than he was in the habit of employing. But its
general purpose, which I have endeavoured to give in a paraphrase, seems to be very much what
such a man would have said at such a moment. The authority for Mackay's speech will be found
in his own despatch to Lord Melville after the battle.

[103] It was the disastrous experience of this day that led Mackay to devise a plan of fixing
the bayonet to the musket so that each could be used, as now, without interfering with the other.

[104] "History of the Rebellions in Scotland." Even the men who had stood by Lord Murray joined
in the slaughter. He did his best to keep them quiet, but was forced to own afterwards to Mackay
that he had not been very successful. "It cannot be helped," he wrote, "of almost all country
people, who are ready to pillage and plunder whenever they have occasion." See the Bannatyne
edition of Dundee's Letters, &c.

[105] Mackay's opinion was that "the English commonalty were to be preferred in matter of courage
to the Scots."

[106] One tradition, for a long while current among the Lowlands, declares him to have been
shot by one of his own men in the pay of William Livingstone, who afterwards married Lady Dundee;
Livingstone having been for some weeks a close prisoner in Edinburgh with the other disaffected
officers of his regiment. Lady Dundee, the story goes on to say, was aware of his intentions,
and on the following New Year's day sent "the supposed assassin a white night-cap, a pair of
white gloves, and a rope, being a sort of suit of canonicals for the gallows, either to signify
that she esteemed him worthy of that fate, or that she thought the state of his mind might
be such as to make him fit to hang himself." Another tradition makes Dundee fall by a shot
fired from the window of Urrard House, in which a party of Mackay's men had lodged themselves.
He was watering his horse at the time at a pond called the Goose-Dub, where the Laird of Urrard's
geese were wont to disport themselves. This story is evidently part of the old nurse's prophecy
mentioned on page 3. For these and many other anecdotes of the battle, see the "History of
the Rebellions in Scotland." I have taken my account of Dundee's death from the memoirs of
Balcarres and Lochiel, and from the depositions, printed by Napier, of certain witnesses examined
afterwards at Edinburgh, among them being an officer of Kenmure's regiment, who was carried
prisoner into the castle after the battle and heard Johnstone's story. As for the letter said
to have been written by Dundee to James after the battle, and now among the Nairne Papers,
there is more to be said for it than some have allowed. Macaulay, alluding to it as dated the
day after the battle, calls it as impudent a forgery as Fingal. But in fact it bears no date
at all: the handwriting is declared on the best authority to be beyond question contemporary;
and there is no absolute proof that Dundee did not live long enough at least to dictate an
account of his victory to James. It is tolerably certain that he would have done so had his
strength permitted him. But in a letter written from Dublin in the following November by James
to Ballechin, there is no mention of any letter from Dundee, and his death is there alluded
to as having occurred at the beginning of the action. This, of course, is not conclusive; James's
actual words are, "the loss you had ... at your entrance into action," which need not imply
instant death. On the whole, however, the balance of evidence seems to me to prove that Dundee
died where he fell, and that the letter is not genuine, though certainly no forgery of Macpherson's.
Those who are still curious on a point which is, after all, of no very great importance, will
find it amply discussed in a note to the edition of Dundee's letters published for the Bannatyne
Club, and in an appendix to Napier's third volume. A stone still marks the spot where Dundee
is said to have fallen, and was seen by Captain Burt less than fifty years after the battle.

TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:

VARIANT SPELLINGS Page vi: John Mackay is of Rockfield (p. vi); and Rockfields (p. 16 and index,
under Mackay). Amended Rockfield to Rockfields.

Page vi.: Variant spelling of Scourie and Scowrie retained, however, as the author could well
have spelled it Scowrie (though online historical sources suggest Hugh Mackay was born at Scourie).

Page 133: Hyslop has been in all other instances spelt Hislop; corrected.

Page 159: "bloodly Clavers" matches book: retained.

Variant spelling of doggerel/doggrel (one instance of each) retained.

VARIANT CAPITALISATIONS Inconsistent capitalisation of Council-Board and Council-board (one
instance of each) retained.

Capitalisation of Churchman (p. 9) and Legislature (p. 9) retained

The Killing Time variously capitalised as killing-time, Killing-time, Killing-Time and Killing
Time (one of each). Two of these are enclosed in quote marks and one is in the index. Retained.

Popery and popery/popish and Popish variant capitalisations retained (read properly in context).

VARIANT SPELLINGS IN QUOTED LETTERS While the author notes that Claverhouse could not spell
correctly (for example p. 6), the only misspellings that appear in the reproduced letters are
proper names: there are no other spelling errors. It would appear that the transcriber was
correcting the common English without correcting the proper names. Subsequently the following
misspelled proper names have been corrected:

Page 108: Mauchlin corrected to Mauchline.

Page 138: Sanquar corrected to Sanquhar (spelt correctly in a previous letter, p. 108).

Page 188: Variant spelling of Locheil, elsewhere Lochiel, corrected. In the same letter there
is a reference to Queenberry (otherwise Queensberry), ditto corrected.

Page 190: Kircudbright corrected to Kirkcudbright (spelt correctly in at least 3 previous letters,
see pp. 54, 93 and 94).

HYPHENS One instance of each headquarters, head-quarters and one split over the end of a line.
Settled on headquarters as the more common spelling.

PUNCTUATION Page 69: "; amended to ;", which is the standard punctuation arrangement in the book.

Page 188: "strangely, For" amended to "strangely. For".

Page 192: Editorial comment in quoted letter (that) is in parentheses and not square brackets
as has been used elsewhere in book. Amended to square brackets.

MISCELLANEOUS TOC created for this text (no TOC in the original book)

Page 117: "...I caused shoot him dead;" checks out against original book. Left as is.

Index: Page reference for Whigs, origin of name fixed to page 23 (footnote 8); no note on page
82 (original reference in book).
