*** This work consists of 139 leaves, exclusive of
      the table, occupying two leaves. The Colophon of
      the Printer is one of great interest, filling
      the two last pages. It thus commences:--"Thur

On the following Monday will commence the sale of the theological portion of his collection,
which will occupy eight days, and conclude on the 4th of December. The sales are entrusted
to the management of Messrs. S. Leigh Sotheby & Co. of Wellington Street.

We have also received from Mr. Asher of Berlin, a copy of the _Bibliotheca Tieckiana_--the
sale catalogue of the library of Ludwig Tieck, the distinguished German poet, novelist, and
critic. The sale will commence at Berlin on the 10th December, with the English portion of
the library, which besides the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th folios, is particularly rich in works illustrative
of Shakespeare, and of translations of various portions of our great dramatist's writings.
The following lot, comprising an edition, we believe, not very generally known, and containing
the manuscript notes and comments of so profound a critic as Ludwig Tieck, ought to find an
English purchaser.

  2152  THE PLAYS OF W. SHAKSPEARE, with the Corrections
        and Illustrations of various Commentators,
        to which are added Notes by Johnson and
        Steevens. 23 vols. gr. in 8vo. Basil 1800-1802

  "Exemplaire unique et de la plus grande importance,
      contenant des notes sans nombre de la main de
      M. Tieck. Ces notes renferment les fruits d'une
      étude de plus de 40 ans sur le grand poète, par
      son plus grand traducteur et commentateur, et
      forment le texte du grand ouvrage sur Shakspeare,
      promis depuis si longtemps."

One of the most curious articles in this catalogue, copies of which may be obtained from the
London Agent for the sale, Mr. Nutt, of the Strand, is No. 1965, a copy of Lilly's _Sixe Court
Comedies_, which had belonged to Oliver Cromwell, and appears to contain his autograph.

There are few literary men who have not, in the course of some one or other of their inquiries,
experienced the difficulty there is in procuring copies of pamphlets which being for the most
part originally published for purposes of temporary interest, are rarely preserved by binding,
and consequently when afterwards wanted become extremely difficult of attainment. We all remember
the valuable Catalogue published many years since by Mr. Rodd, of Newport Street, the father
of Mr. Thomas Rodd, and have often regretted the loss of our copy of that extensive collection;
and we record now for the information of our readers the publication by Mr. Russell Smith,
of 4. Old Compton Street, of Part I. of a Catalogue of a singular and unique collection of
25,000 ancient and modern Tracts and Pamphlets: containing I. Biography, Literary History,
and Criticism; II. Trials, Civil and Criminal; III. Bibliography and Typography; IV. Heraldry
and Family History; V. Archæology; VI. Architecture, Painting, and Sculpture; VII. Music; VIII.
Metaphysics.

NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.

The matter is so generally understood with regard to the management of periodical works, that
it is hardly necessary for the Editor to say that HE CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO RETURN MANUSCRIPTS;
but on one point he wishes to offer a few words of explanation to his correspondents in general,
and particularly to those who do not enable him to communicate with them except in print. They
will see, on a very little reflection, that it is plainly his interest to take all he can get,
and make the most, and the best, of everything; and therefore he begs them to take for granted
that their communications are received, and appreciated, even if the succeeding Number bears
no proof of it. He is convinced that the want of specific acknowledgment will only be felt
by those who have no idea of the labour and difficulty attendant on the hurried management
of such a work, and of the impossibility of sometimes giving an explanation, when there really
is one which would quite satisfy the writer, for the delay or non-insertion of his communication.
Correspondents in such cases have no reason, and if they understood an editor's position they
would feel that they have no right, to consider themselves under-valued; but nothing short
of personal experience in editorship would explain to them the perplexities and evil consequences
arising from an opposite course.

CONTENTS AND INDEX.--Our correspondents will see that their wish for a _Table of Contents_
to each number has been complied with. We are fully aware how much the value of a work like
"NOTES AND QUERIES" is enhanced by a good INDEX. It is intended to give a very copious one
at the end of each volume, so as to make the work one not merely of temporary interest, but
of permanent utility.

BOOKS AND ODD VOLUMES WANTED. We believe that this will prove one of the most useful divisions
of our weekly Sheet. Gentlemen who may be unable to meet with any book or volume, of which
they are in want, may be upon furnishing name, date, size, &c., have it inserted in this list,
_free of cost_. Persons having such volumes to dispose of are requested to send reports of
price, &c. to Mr. Bell, our Publisher.

We have received many complaints of a difficulty in procuring our paper. Every Bookseller and
Newsvendor will supply it _if ordered_, and gentlemen residing in the country may be supplied
regularly with the Stamped Edition by giving their orders direct to the publisher, Mr. GEORGE
BELL, 186. Fleet Street, accompanied by a Post Office order for a quarter (4s. 4d.). All communications
should be addressed To the Editor of "NOTES AND QUERIES," 186. Fleet Street.

THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND; from the time of the Conquest.

"It supplies what was much wanted--a regular and progressive account of English legal institutions.
The result is a correction of many errors, in addition of much new information, and a better
general view of our strictly legal history than any other jurist, historian, or biographer
had hitherto attempted to give."--_Examiner._

THE CHORAL RESPONSES and LITANIES of the UNITED CHURCH of ENGLAND and IRELAND. Collected from

The present Work contains a full collection of the harmonized compositions of ancient date,
including nine sets of pieces and responses, and fifteen litanies, with a few of the more ancient
Psalm Chants. They are given in full score, and in their proper cliffs. In the upper part,
however, the treble is substituted for the "cantus" or "medius" cliff: and the whole work is
so arranged as to suit the library of the musical student, and to be fit for use in the Choir.

THE HISTORY OF JUNIUS AND HIS WORKS, and a Review of the Controversy respecting Junius, with
an Appendix, containing Portraits and Sketches, by Junius, selected from the Letters. By JOHN
JAQUES.

    "This is a very able book; well arranged in its plan, and complete
    in its matter. To those who are interested in the controversy, or
    even to any readers of Junius who wish for further information
    than the common editions furnish, we strongly recommend this
    volume. They will find it full, without being overcharged; and
    it possesses an advantage even over Woodfall's edition, in only
    containing what is essential to the point, besides exhibiting much
    which does not appear in that elaborate publication. The 'History
    of Junius and his Works' is an essential companion to the 'Letters
    of Junius.'"--_Spectator_, March 4. 1843.

GOTHIC ORNAMENTS; being a Series of Examples of Enriched Details and Accessories of the Architecture
of Great Britain. Drawn from existing Authorities. By JAMES K. COLLING, Architect.

The particular object of this work is "to exhibit such a number of examples of foliage and
other ornamental details of the different styles as clearly to elucidate the characteristic
features peculiar to each period; and drawn sufficiently large in scale to be practically useful
in facilitating the labours of the Architect and Artist."

The first volume consists of 104 plates, 19 of which are highly finished in colours. The second
volume, which will complete the work, is now in progress, and will be finished during 1850.

ON THE HISTORY AND ART OF WARMING AND VENTILATING Rooms and Buildings by Open Fires, Hypocausts,
German, Dutch, Russia, and Swedish Stoves, Steam, Hot Water, Heated Air, Heat of Animals, and
other methods; with Notices of the progress of Personal and Fireside Comfort, and of the management
of Fuel. By WALTER BERNAN, Civil Engineer.

    "Since Stuart's 'Anecdotes of the Steam Engine,' there has been no
    such bit of delicious mechanical gossip as this little book of Mr.
    Bernan.... For six months or more every year, we must depend much
    more on the resources of science and the practical arts for our
    health and comfort, than on the natural climate: in short, we
    must create our own climate. To help us to the means of doing
    this appears to be one of the objects of these little volumes, in
    which, as we have shown, are collected a multitude of expedients
    of all times and nations, collected with research, selected with
    judgment, and skilfully arranged and described. The interest
    with which one reads is sustained and continuous, and you devour
    a two-volume inventory of stoves, grates, and ovens, with the
    voracity of a parish school-boy, and then--ask for more."--_The
    Athenæum_.
