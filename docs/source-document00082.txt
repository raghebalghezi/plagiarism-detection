The final stage is the stage of physical violence, when the chief bears lean over the barricade
and shake their paws at the Master; they think they are only making legal gestures, but the
Master knows very well that they are getting out of hand; he knows then that it is time he
threw them a bun. So he says a soothing word to each of them and runs his pen savagely through
almost everything on their papers. The bears growl in stupefaction and rage, and take deep
breaths to begin again. But meanwhile the keeper has shouted for a fresh set of bears, who
surge wildly into the room. The old bears are swept aside and creep out, grunting. What the
result of it all is I don't know. Nobody knows. But the new bears----

AT THE PLAY.

"MARY ROSE."

OF course nobody could possibly suspect Sir JAMES BARRIE of plagiarising (save from himself),
yet it will explain something of the atmosphere of _Mary Rose_ if I say that it is a story
with such a theme as that admirable ghostmonger, the Provost of Eton, would whole-heartedly
approve--thrilling, sinister, inconclusive--with (shall I say?) just a dash of Sir ARTHUR CONAN
DOYLE in his other-worldly mood to bring it well into the movement. Naturally the variations
are sheer BARRIE and of the most adroit.

    [Illustration: THE BOY WHO WOULD GROW UP FASTER THAN HIS
    MOTHER.

    _Mary Rose_ . . . MISS FAY COMPTON.
    _Harry_ . . . .   MR. ROBERT LORAINE.]

_Mary Rose_ is in fact a girl who couldn't grow up, because whenever she visited a little mystery
island in the Outer Hebrides "they" who lived in a "lovely, lovely, lovely" vague world beyond
these voices would call her vaguely (to Mr. NORMAN O'NEILL'S charming music), and she would
as vaguely return with no memory of what had passed and no change in her physical condition.
This didn't matter so much when, as a mere child, she disappeared for thirty days; but when,
mother of an incomparable heir of two, she was rapt away in the middle of a picnic for twenty-five
years, and returned to find a husband, mother and father inexplicably old and changed, and
dreadfully silent about her babe--well, you see for yourself how hopeless everything was. As
if there were not enough real tragedy in the world and it were necessary to invent!

I don't think it fair to tell you any more. You shouldn't suffer these thrills at second-hand.
But I can say that, in spite of making it a point of professional honour to try to keep a warm
spine and check the unbidden tear from trickling down my nose (which makes you look such an
ass before a cynical colleague during the intervals), I was beaten in both attempts. The "effects"
were astonishingly well contrived by both author and producer (Mr. HOLMAN CLARK). You were
not let down at the supreme moment by a hurried shuffle of dimly seen forms or the click of
an electrician's gear suggesting too solid flesh. The house was in a queer way stunned by the
poignancy of the last scene between the young ghost-mother and the long-sought unrecognised
son, and had to shake itself before it could reward with due applause the fine playing of as
perfect a cast as I have seen for a long time. There's no manner of doubt that Sir JAMES "got
it over" (as they say) all right.

Miss FAY COMPTON makes astonishing strides. Her _Mary Rose_ had adorable shy movements, caresses,
intonations, wistfulnesses. These were traits of _Mary Rose_, not tricks of Miss COMPTON. And
they escaped monotony--supreme achievement in the difficult circumstances. Mr. ROBERT LORAINE
in the doubled _rôles_ of _Mary Rose's_ husband and son, showed a very fine skill in his differentiation
of the husband's character in three phases of time and development, and of the son's, with
its family likeness and individual variation. Mr. ERNEST THESIGER, who seems to touch nothing
he does not adorn, gave a fine rendering of as charming a character as ever came out of the
BARRIE box--the superstitious, learned, courteous crofter's son, student of Aberdeen University,
temporary boatman and (later) minister. He did his best incidentally, by rowing away without
casting off, to corroborate the local legend that the queer little island sometimes disappeared.
Miss MARY JERROLD was just the perfect BARRIE mother (of _Mary Rose_). Mr. ARTHUR WHITBY'S
parson, Mr. NORMAN FORBES' squire, Miss JEAN CADELL'S housekeeper, left no chinks in their
armour for a critic's spleenful arrow.

THE CONNOISSEUR.

  No more to bits of china (though I love it),
    To coloured prints no more my fancy roams,
  Or all the works of art I used to covet
    In other people's homes.

  Old first editions, Sheffield plate and brasses,
    Weapons of CROMWELL'S time and coats of mail,
  Gate-tables, QUEEN ANNE chairs and aught that passes
    For craft of CHIPPENDALE--

  Such things no more I spend my hard-earned cash on
    (Fain though the spirit be, the purse is weak);
  Yet strong within me burns the ruling passion
    For anything antique.

  To haunt the sales for "finds" no more my job is;
    I've found at length, to satisfy my bent,
  A wider sphere for this my last of hobbies,
    Which costs me not a cent;

  Where I can see my friends possess the treasure
    Their souls desire, nor envy them for that;
  My game's to scan my fellow-man at leisure
    Divested of his hat;

  Among my own coevals, whom at last Time
    Is taking by the locks at forty-nine,
  Searching (a quaint but inexpensive pastime)
    For balder heads than mine.

HINTS ON ADVERTISING.

IN the belief that the numerous signs and notices, such as those containing warnings and advice
to the public, with which the eye is so familiar, might be employed as suitable _media_ for
commercial advertisement, the following suggestions are offered for what they are worth:--

      =LIFT NOT WORKING.=

    When you walk upstairs
    be sure your boots are
    shod with PUSSYFOOT
       Rubber Heels.

       * * *

        =TO STOP THE TRAIN PULL
           DOWN THE CORD.=

    Then light a NAVY LIST Cigarette.

      That alone is worth the £5.

       * * *

      =STICK NO BILLS.=

     It's not your job.

    Let STIKKOTINE do it.

      Sticks anything.

       * * *

     =THIS RACK IS PROVIDED FOR
       LIGHT ARTICLES ONLY.=

    If your baby is a GLOXO baby
       keep it on your knee.

    GLOXO builds _bulky_ bairns.

       * * *

      =KEEP OFF THE GRASS.=

    Unless you are wearing
        GUMBOODLE'S
         Goloshes.
       Won't wet feet.

       * * *

    =BEWARE OF THE DOG.=

    Wait till he hears
    HIS MASTER'S VOICE.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

(_By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks._)

I HAVE a mild grievance against that talented lady, Miss MARJORIE BOWEN, for labelling her
latest novel "a romantic fantasy." Because, like all her other stories, _The Cheats_ (COLLINS)
moves with such an air of truth, its personages are so human, that I could delightfully persuade
myself that it was all true, and that I had really shared, with a sometimes quickened pulse,
the strange fortunes of the sombre young hero. But--fantasy! That is to show the strings and
give away the whole game. However, if you can forget that, the coils of an admirably woven
intrigue will grip your attention and sympathy throughout. The central figure is one _Jaques_,
who comes to town as a penniless and love-lorn romantic, to be confronted with the revelation
that he is himself the eldest son, unacknowledged but legitimate, of His Majesty KING CHARLES
THE SECOND, then holding Court at Whitehall. It is from the plots and counter-plots, the machinations
and subterfuges that follow that Miss BOWEN justifies her title. Certainly _The Cheats_ establishes
her in my mind as our first writer of historical fiction. The character-drawing is admirable
(especially of poor weak-willed vacillating _Jaques_, a wonderfully observed study of the STUART
temperament). More than ever, also, Miss BOWEN might here be said to write her descriptions
with a paint-brush; the whole tale goes by in a series of glowing pictures, most richly coloured.
_The Cheats_ is not a merry book; its treatment of the foolish heroine in particular abates
nothing of grim justice; but of its art there can be no two opinions. I wish again that I had
been allowed to believe in it.
