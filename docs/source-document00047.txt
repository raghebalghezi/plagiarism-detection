NO. IV.--THE "OVER-THE-CLIFF" MURDER.

[Illustration]

  It may be this--that the Villain base
    Has insulted the hero's girl;
  It may be this--that he's brought disgrace
    On a wretchedly-acted Earl.
  I care not which it may chance to be,
    Only this do I chance to know--
  A cliff looks down at a canvas sea
    And some property rocks below!

  You say, perhaps, it is only there
    From a love of the picturesque--
  You hint, maybe, that it takes no share
    In the plot of this weird burlesque;
  But cliffs that tremble at every touch,
    And that flap in the dreadful draught,
  Have something better to do--ah, much!
    Than to criticise Nature's craft!

  The cliff is there, and the ocean too,
    And the property rocks below.
  (These last, as yet, don't appear to you,
    But they're somewhere behind, I know.)
  The cliff is there, and the sea besides
    (As I fancy I've said before),
  And yonder alone _the_ Villain hides
    Who is thirsting for someone's gore!

  And now there comes to the Villain bold
    The unfortunate Villain Two.
  He's here to ask for the promised gold
    For the deeds he has had to do.
  But words run high, and a struggle strong
    Sends the cliff rocking to and fro,
  And Villain Two topples off ere long
    To the property rocks below!

  The scene is changed. The revolving cliff
    Now exhibits its other side.
  The corpse is there, looking very stiff--
    Even more than before it died!
  The crime is traced to the hero JACK,
    Notwithstanding the stupids know
  Deceased was thrown by the Villain black
    To the property rocks below!

RHYMES FOR READERS OF REMINISCENCES.

  If the day's (as usual) pitchy,
  Take up ANNE THACKERAY RITCHIE!
  If you're feeling "quisby-snitchy,"
  Seek the fire--and read your RITCHIE!
  If your nerves are slack or twitchy,
  Quiet them with soothing RITCHIE.
  If you're dull as water ditchy,
  You'll be cheered by roseate RITCHIE.
  Be you achey, sore, chill, itchy,
  Rest you'll find in Mrs. RITCHIE!
  May her light ne'er shine with slacker ray,
  Gentle daughter of great THACKERAY!

ICHABOD!

     ["Mr. HENRY BLACKBURN, lecturing at the London Institution, Finsbury
     Circus, said English people were not an artistic nation, and instead
     of getting better, they appeared to be rapidly getting worse. The
     author of the present day was losing the sincerity and the
     individuality which ought to characterise him.--_Daily Paper._"]

  Oh, gaily did we hasten to the London Institution,
    Expecting some amusement in our inartistic way,
  And little did we reckon on the awful retribution
    Which Mr. HENRY BLACKBURN had in store for us that day.

  We'd fondly looked towards him for an eulogistic blessing,
    But got instead a general and comprehensive curse,
  We are, as he informed us, with an emphasis distressing,
    By nature inartistic, and are daily getting worse.

  Thereafter he directed magisterial attention
    Upon the hapless authors who a fleeting fame had got;
  He drew no nice distinctions, nor selected some for mention,
    But, with superb simplicity, he just condemned the lot.

  Every man of them is sinning with an ignorance persistent,
    Poet, novelist and critic, or whatever be their sphere,
  Their "individuality" is almost non-existent,
    And only on occasions, if at all, are they "sincere."

  Well, what, then, is the remedy? Will Mr. BLACKBURN fix it?
    Must all our fiction travel from the cultured Continent?
  Or dares we snap our fingers at this haughty _ipse dixit_,
    And read our inartistic books in very great content?

MR. PERKS, M.P., has undertaken to bring in a Bill for "the Abolition of Registrars at Nonconformist

LUSUS NATURÆ.

In the _Field's_ Dog-for-sale column, there recently appeared, wedged in between descriptions
of vendible Beagles and Bloodhound Pups, the following remarkable advertisement:--

     BLOODHOUND, 40-Tonner, for SALE; built by Fife of Fairlie; has all
     lead ballast, and very complete inventory.--For price, which is
     moderate, and particulars, apply, &c.

Most interesting canine specimen this. The Managers of the Zoological Gardens should at once
apply, if by this time they have not already done so, and secured the "Forty-tonner Bloodhound,"
with complete inventory, "built by FIFE of Fairlie."

Nursery-Rhyme for the Neo-Crinolinists.

  Come with balloon-skirts, or come not at all!

A Candid Friend.

     SCENE--_Brown's Study--the well-known "Brown's Study," of course._
     BROWN _is reading the fortieth chapter of his three-volume
     Autobiography to_ JONES.

_Brown_ (_pausing in his gigantic work_). Well, tell me, honestly, have you any fault to find
with it?

_Jones._ Well--hum!--_it wants finish_.

     [_Looks at his watch, rises hurriedly, and exits quickly._

Why, on an Illustrated Paper, should the position of the reproducer of Artists' black-and-white
work be a higher one than that of the Artists themselves? Because he undertakes "Graver" responsibilities.

BURIDAN'S ASS.

(_Modern Agricultural Version._)

[Illustration]

     [BURIDAN is said to have been the inventor of the dilemma of the ass
     between two absolutely equal bundles of hay, he maintaining that the
     ass's choice must be so equally balanced that he would starve, there
     being no motive for preference.]

  Long-patient Issachar, o'erladen muncher
    Of heaps of "vacant chaff well-meant for grain,"
  If, like the pious spouse of _Jerry Cruncher_,
    You "flop," and, camel-wise, won't rise again
  To bear big burdens that strength staggers under,
  On fodder most inadequate, what wonder?

  To wallop a poor "donkey wot won't go,"
    The good old song suggests is cruel folly.
  Give him some fragrant hay, _then_ cry "Gee-woa!"
    The lyrist hints, in diction quaintly jolly.
  From starving moke you'll get no progress steady;
  The well-fed ass responds to "Gee-up, Neddy!"

  Poor brute, between two piles of sapless chaff,
    While such big burdens weigh your weary shoulders,
  Your choice _is_ difficult! Cynics may laugh,
    But pity for your plight moves kind beholders.
  Cockneys cry, "Kim hup, Neddy!" or "Woa, Emma!"
  But _Punch_ compassionates your hard dilemma.

  What choice between the chaff of arid Rad
    And that of equally dry-and-dusty Tory?
  CHAPLIN would feed you on preposterous fad,
    And GARDNER on--postponement! The old story!
  While the grass grows the horse may starve. Poor ass!
  Party would bring you to a similar pass!

  "A certain Mister JESSE COLLINGS" poses
    As your particular friend and patron. Quite so!
  JOSEPH and he cock their pugnacious noses
    At their old Chief, venting their zeal (_and_ spite) so.
  CODLIN--no, COLLINGS--is the friend. "Lard bless 'ee,
  Turn WILLYUM oop, and try JOSEPH and JESSE!"

  "WILLYUM"--who wields a very pretty flail--
    Drubs them delightfully, 'midst general laughter.
  But oh, poor ass, aching from head to tail,
    Pray, what the better is _your_ state thereafter?
  BURIDAN'S Ass was surely your twin brother.
  There's such small difference 'twixt one and t'other!

POLITICS IN PLAY.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I notice that that eminent author, Mr. HENRY ARTHUR JONES, has written a play
called _The Bauble Shop_, in which he has introduced the room of the Prime Minister in the
House of Commons as one of his most striking _tableaux_. I have not yet had the advantage of
seeing what I feel sure must be an admirable comedy, but in justice to myself I must ask you
to publish a portion of a piece of my own, which seems to me to bear some resemblance to what
I suppose I must call (as it has enjoyed priority of production) the Criterion original. I
call _my_ drama _The Walking Gentleman, or the Young Premier_, and I beg to submit to you the
last Scene (a very short one) of the last Act. Here it is _in extenso_:--

     SCENE.--ANGELINA'S _Boudoir_. ANGELINA _discovered waiting for_ EDWIN.

_Angelina_ (_anxiously_). And, will he never come! Ah! that House--that House! With its blazing
beacon from the Clock Tower; it----(_With a cry of joy._) Ah, he is here!

_Edwin_ (_entering hurriedly and taking_ ANGELINA _in his arms_). My own one! Yes, I say it
advisedly, my own one! Mine--Mine--for ever!

_Ang._ Nay, EDWIN; you forget the claims the Government--the country--have upon your time!

_Edw._ No, darling, I do not. The Division has been taken; it is all over. At the last moment
I rose in my place in the House, and made purposely one of the most injudicious orations ever
heard within those respected walls. I disgusted friends, alienated adherents, and in every
possible manner strengthened the hands of the Opposition; and, darling we are beaten--yes,
beaten--by a thumping majority.

_Ang._ (_in tears_). Oh, EDWIN, EDWIN! I am so sorry!

_Edw._ Nay, do not weep. For thy dear sake I accepted the sacrifice. I am no longer leader
of the House, I am no longer head of the Administration, and now I shall have ample leisure.
Yes, darling, smile once more. Now I shall have time to be married. Now I can speak with hope
of a honeymoon!

(_Curtain._)

There, _Mr. Punch_! If that would not overwhelm the Stalls and Boxes with painful emotion,
and bring down the Pit and Gallery with thunders of applause, I am a Dutchman!

Yours obediently, GARRICK SHAKSPEARE SNOOKS.

MARY-ANNER ON THE COMING MODE.

     ["That there is much to be said for crinoline on hygienic grounds, and
     on those of cleanliness, must be obvious to its most prejudiced
     opponents."--Lady JEUNE "_In Defence of Crinoline_."]

  DEAR POLLY,--This comes hooping--I mean hoping, as you're heard,
  As the QUEEN and the PRINCESS O' WALES declines to be absurd,
  And put their foot in it--dear me!--I mean to put it down
  Upon the coming Crinerline! A-arsting of the Crown
  To hinterfere with hus, dear,--wich I means the female sect,--
  In our Fashions, is fair himperence. But, wot _can_ yer expect
  From parties--wich they may be litterary, or may _not_--
  As carn't see any beauty in balloon-skirts? Reglar rot!
  I'm a-pinin' for it, POLLY, wich in course, my dear, I mean
  That convenient, cleanly cover-all, wot's called the Crinerline!
  _It hides so much_, my POLLY; wich I'm sure, my dear, you'll twig!
  As dear Lady JUNE informs hus, the too-little or too-big,
  The scraggy and the crummy ones, the lanky 'uns and the lumps,
  Will be grateful for a fashion as is kind to bones and 'umps.
  Eel-skin skirts may suit the swells, dear, and the straight, and slim,
            and tall,
  And--well, them whose wardrobe's plentiful; they don't suit _me_ at all;
  Wich I'm four-foot-ten and stoutish, as to you is well beknown;
  I'm a bit short in the legs like, my limbs do _not_ run to bone.
  Now my purse won't run to petticuts and cetrer _hevery_ week,
  As a pound a month won't do it. Ho! it's like their blessed cheek,
  Missis JOHN STRANGE WINTER'S Ammyzons as Lady JUNE remarks--
  To swear Crinerline is "ojus," dear, and 'idjous. 'Twill be larks
  To see _them_ a wearin 'ooped-skirts, as in course they're bound to do,
  When they fair become the fashion. Yus, for all their bubbaroo.
  The seving thousand Leaguers, and their Leader will cave in,
  And wear wot now they swear is jest a shame, dear, and a sin.
  I do not care a snap wot the opinion of the men is,
  Nor yet for the hesthetecks, nor the toffs as play at Tennis;
  I sez 'Ooped Skirts for hever! This STRANGE WINTER'S out o' tune,
  I prefers the Summer, POLLY, wich I mean dear Lady JUNE.
  Anti-Crinerline be jiggered! I've got one dear mother wore,
  Though the steels is a bit twisted, and the stuff a trifle tore,
  I can fake it up, when Fashion gives the watch-word, I've no doubt,
  And I ony wish 'twould come, dear, with my first fine Sunday hout.
  Drat these sniffy snapping Leaguers! Ho! they fancy they're high-tone,
  But I'll give 'em the straight griffin. Leave our petticuts alone!
  They may take it from me, POLLY, they'll soon drop their bloomin' banner,
  If all women show the sperrit of,

Yours trooly, MARY-ANNER.

THE MAN FROM BLANKLEY'S.

A STORY IN SCENES.

     SCENE VI.--_The Dining-room, as before._ Lord STRATHSPORRAN _is still
     endeavouring to grasp the situation_.

_Lord Strath._ (_to himself_). Don't want to make a fuss, but I suppose I ought to do _something_.
Good little chap, my host--didn't like to tell me I'd made a mistake; but his wife's a downright
vixen. Better make it right with her. (_To_ Mrs. TID.). I--I'm afraid I ought to have found
out long before this what an intruder you must consider me; but your husband----.

_Mrs. Tid._ Pray say no more. Mr. TIDMARSH chose to act on his own responsibility, and of course
_I_ must put up with the consequences.

_Lord Strath._ (_to himself_). It's hard lines to have to leave MARJORY like this; but this
is more than I _can_----(_Aloud._) After that, of course I can only offer to relieve you of
my presence as soon as----

_Mrs. Tid._ (_horrified_). Not for _worlds_! I can't have my party broken up _now_. I _insist_
on your staying. I--I have no complaint to make of your conduct--_so far_!
