Notes and Definitions

In addition to the updating of information, the following changes have been made in this edition
of The World Factbook. The entity of Serbia and Montenegro is now officially known as Yugoslavia.
There are new entries on:  Currency code, HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate, HIV/AIDS - deaths,
HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS, Internet users, and Internet country code.  The Background
entry, which was introduced in the 1999 edition, has now been completed for all 267 entities
in the Factbook.  The individual country maps are being revised.  Some new maps with elevation
extremes and a partial geographic grid are included in this edition.

Abbreviations This information is included in Appendix A: Abbreviations, which includes all
abbreviations and acronyms used in the Factbook, with their expansions.

Acronyms An acronym is an abbreviation coined from the initial letter of each successive word
in a term or phrase.  In general, an acronym made up solely from the first letter of the major
words in the expanded form is rendered in all capital letters (NATO from North Atlantic Treaty
Organization; an exception would be ASEAN for Association of Southeast Asian Nations).  In
general, an acronym made up of more than the first letter of the major words in the expanded
form is rendered with only an initial capital letter (Comsat from Communications Satellite
Corporation; an exception would be NAM from Nonaligned Movement). Hybrid forms are sometimes
used to distinguish between initially identical terms (WTO:  WTrO for World Trade Organization
and WToO for World Tourism Organization.)

Administrative divisions This entry generally gives the numbers, designatory terms, and first-
order administrative divisions as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes
that have been reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.

Age structure This entry provides the distribution of the population according to age. Information
is included by sex and age group (0-14 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over). The age structure
of a population affects a nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with young populations
(high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in schools, while countries with older populations
(high percentage ages 65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The age structure
can also be used to help predict potential political issues. For example, the rapid growth
of a young adult population unable to find employment can lead to unrest.

Agriculture - products This entry is a rank ordering of major crops and products starting with
the most important.

Airports This entry gives the total number of airports. The runway(s) may be paved (concrete
or asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces), but must be usable.
Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.

Airports - with paved runways This entry gives the total number of airports with paved runways
(concrete or asphalt surfaces). For airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway
is included according to the following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m,
(3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways
are included in this listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance,
or air traffic control.

Airports - with unpaved runways This entry gives the total number of airports with unpaved
runways (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces). For airports with more than one runway, only
the longest runway is included according to the following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2)
2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only airports
with usable runways are included in this listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,
maintenance, or air traffic control

Appendixes This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.

Area This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of all land and water areas
delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all
surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water bodies
(lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of all water surfaces delimited by international
boundaries and/or coastlines, including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).

Area - comparative This entry provides an area comparison based on total area equivalents.
Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states based on area measurements
(1990 revised) provided by the US Bureau of the Census. The smaller entities are compared with
Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi,
146 acres).

Background This entry usually highlights major historic events and current issues and may include
a statement about one or two key future trends.

Birth rate This entry gives the average annual number of births during a year per 1,000 persons
in the population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate. The birth rate is usually the
dominant factor in determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both the level
of fertility and the age structure of the population.

Budget This entry includes revenues, total expenditures, and capital expenditures.  These figures
are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms

Capital This entry gives the location of the seat of government.

Climate This entry includes a brief description of typical weather regimes throughout the year.

Coastline This entry gives the total length of the boundary between the land area (including
islands) and the sea.

Communications This category deals with the means of exchanging information and includes the
telephone, radio, television, and Internet service provider entries.

Communications - note This entry includes miscellaneous communications information of significance
not included elsewhere.

Constitution This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions, and major amendments.

Country data codes see Data codes

Country map Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in color. The maps were produced
from the best information available at the time of preparation. Names and/or boundaries may
have changed subsequently.

Country name This entry includes all forms of the country's name approved by the US Board on
Geographic Names (Italy is used as an example): conventional long form (Italian Republic),
conventional short form (Italy), local long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short form (Italia),
former (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation. Also see the Terminology note.

Currency This entry identifies the national medium of exchange and its basic subunit.

Currency code This entry gives the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4217
alphabetic currency code for each country.

Data codes This information is presented in Appendix D:  Cross-Reference List of Country Data
Codes and Appendix E:  Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data Codes.  This appendix includes
the US Government approved Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes, the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) codes, and Internet codes for land entities.  The appendix
also includes the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) codes, Aeronautical Chart and
Information Center (ACIC; now a part of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency or NIMA) codes,
and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) codes for hydrographic entities. The US Government has
not yet approved a standard for hydrographic data codes similar to the FIPS 10-4 standard for
country data codes.

Date of information In general, information available as of 1 January 2001, was used in the
preparation of this edition.
