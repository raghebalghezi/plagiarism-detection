  ago. I'd only just got into my dressing-room before Lady Adela came.
 I've been writing letters in the hall since Colford and I finished
   billiards.
    
   CANYNGE. You weren't up for anything in
  between?
 
  DANCY. No.
   
  MARGARET. The mystery of the
 grey room.

  DANCY. Oughtn't the grounds to be searched for
     footmarks?
    
   CANYNGE. That's for the police.
  
   DANCY. The deuce! Are they coming?
    

CANYNGE.

Directly.

[A knock] Yes?

TREISURE enters.

Well?

TREISURE. The ladder has not been moved, General. There isn't a sign.

WINSOR. All right. Get Robert up, but don't say anything to him. By the way, we're expecting
the police.

TREISURE.

I trust they will not find a mare's nest, sir, if I may say so.

He goes.

WINSOR. De Levis has got wrong with Treisure. [Suddenly] But, I say, what would any of us have
done if we'd been in his shoes?

MARGARET. A thousand pounds? I can't even conceive having it.

DANCY.

We probably shouldn't have found it out.

LADY A. No--but if we had.

DANCY. Come to you--as he did.

WINSOR. Yes; but there's a way of doing things.

CANYNGE.

We shouldn't have wanted the police.

MARGARET. No. That's it. The hotel touch.

LADY A. Poor young man; I think we're rather hard on him.

WINSOR. He sold that weed you gave him, Dancy, to Kentman, the bookie, and these were the
proceeds.

DANCY. Oh!

WINSOR. He'd tried her high, he said.

DANCY. [Grimly] He would.

MABEL. Oh! Ronny, what bad luck!

WINSOR. He must have been followed here. [At the window] After rain like that, there ought to be
footmarks.

The splutter of a motor cycle is heard.

MARGARET. Here's the wind!

WINSOR. What's the move now, General?

CANYNGE. You and I had better see the Inspector in De Levis's room, WINSOR. [To the others]
If you'll all be handy, in case he wants to put questions for himself.

MARGARET. I hope he'll want me; it's just too thrilling.

DANCY. I hope he won't want me; I'm dog-tired. Come on, Mabel. [He puts his arm in his wife's].

CANYNGE. Just a minute, Charles.

He draws dose to WINSOR as the others are departing to their rooms.

WINSOR. Yes, General?

CANYNGE. We must be careful with this Inspector fellow. If he pitches hastily on somebody
in the house it'll be very disagreeable.

WINSOR. By Jove! It will.

CANYNGE. We don't want to rouse any ridiculous suspicion.

WINSOR. Quite. [A knock] Come in!

TREISURE enters.

TREISURE. Inspector Dede, Sir.

WINSOR. Show him in.

TREISURE. Robert is in readiness, sir; but I could swear he knows nothing about it.

WINSOR. All right.

TREISURE re-opens the door, and says "Come in, please." The INSPECTOR enters, blue, formal,
moustachioed, with a peaked cap in his hand.

WINSOR. Good evening, Inspector. Sorry to have brought you out at this time of night.

INSPECTOR. Good evenin', sir. Mr WINSOR? You're the owner here, I think?

WINSOR. Yes. General Canynge.

INSPECTOR. Good evenin', General. I understand, a large sum of money?

WINSOR. Yes. Shall we go straight to the room it was taken from? One of my guests, Mr De
Levis. It's the third room on the left.

CANYNGE.

We've not been in there yet, Inspector; in fact, we've done nothing,
except to find out that the stable ladder has not been moved.

We haven't even searched the grounds.

INSPECTOR. Right, sir; I've brought a man with me.

They go out.

CURTAIN. And interval of a Minute.

SCENE II
[The same set is used for this Scene, with the different arrangement of furniture, as
specified.]
The bedroom of DE LEVIS is the same in shape as WINSOR'S dressing-room, except that there
is only one door--to the corridor. The furniture, however, is differently arranged; a small
four-poster bedstead stands against the wall, Right Back, jutting into the room. A chair,
on which DE LEVIS's clothes are thrown, stands at its foot. There is a dressing-table against
the wall to the left of the open windows, where the curtains are drawn back and a stone
balcony is seen. Against the wall to the right of the window is a chest of drawers, and a
washstand is against the wall, Left. On a small table to the right of the bed an electric
reading lamp is turned up, and there is a light over the dressing-table.

The INSPECTOR is standing plumb centre looking at the bed, and DE LEVIS by the back of the
chair at the foot of the bed. WINSOR and CANYNGE are close to the door, Right Forward.

INSPECTOR. [Finishing a note] Now, sir, if this is the room as you left it for your bath, just
show us exactly what you did after takin' the pocket-book from the suit case. Where was that,
by the way?

DE LEVIS. [Pointing] Where it is now--under the dressing-table.

He comes forward to the front of the chair, opens the pocket-book, goes through the pretence
of counting his shaving papers, closes the pocket-book, takes it to the head of the bed and
slips it under the pillow. Makes the motion of taking up his pyjamas, crosses below the
INSPECTOR to the washstand, takes up a bath sponge, crosses to the door, takes out the key,
opens the door.

INSPECTOR. [Writing]. We now have the room as it was when the theft was committed. Reconstruct
accordin' to 'uman nature, gentlemen--assumin' the thief to be in the room, what would he try
first?--the clothes, the dressin'-table, the suit case, the chest of drawers, and last the
bed.

He moves accordingly, examining the glass on the dressing-table, the surface of the suit
cases, and the handles of the drawers, with a spy-glass, for
finger-marks.

CANYNGE. [Sotto voce to WINSOR] The order would have been just the other way.

The INSPECTOR goes on hands and knees and examines the carpet between
the window and the bed.

DE LEVIS. Can I come in again?

INSPECTOR. [Standing up] Did you open the window, sir, or was it open when you first came
in?

DE LEVIS. I opened it.

INSPECTOR. Drawin' the curtains back first?

DE LEVIS. Yes.

INSPECTOR. [Sharply] Are you sure there was nobody in the room already?

DE LEVIS. [Taken aback] I don't know. I never thought. I didn't look under the bed, if you mean
that.

INSPECTOR. [Jotting] Did not look under bed. Did you look under it after the theft?

DE LEVIS. No. I didn't.

INSPECTOR. Ah! Now, what did you do after you came back from your bath? Just give us that
precisely.

DE LEVIS. Locked the door and left the key in. Put back my sponge, and took off my dressing-gown
and put it there. [He points to the footrails of the bed] Then I
drew the curtains, again.

INSPECTOR. Shutting the window?
DE LEVIS. No. I got into bed, felt for my watch to see the time.
My hand struck the pocket-book, and somehow it felt thinner. I took
it out, looked into it, and found the notes gone, and these shaving
papers instead.
INSPECTOR. Let me have a look at those, sir. [He applies the
spy-glasses] And then?
DE LEVIS. I think I just sat on the bed.
INSPECTOR. Thinkin' and cursin' a bit, I suppose. Ye-es?
DE LEVIS. Then I put on my dressing-gown and went straight to Mr
WINSOR.

INSPECTOR. Not lockin' the door?

DE LEVIS. No.
INSPECTOR. Exactly. [With a certain finality] Now, sir, what time
did you come up?

DE LEVIS. About eleven.
INSPECTOR. Precise, if you can give it me.
DE LEVIS. Well, I know it was eleven-fifteen when I put my watch
under my pillow, before I went to the bath, and I suppose I'd been
about a quarter of an hour undressing. I should say after eleven,
if anything.
INSPECTOR. Just undressin'? Didn't look over your bettin' book?
DE LEVIS. No.

INSPECTOR. No prayers or anything?
DE LEVIS. No.
INSPECTOR. Pretty slippy with your undressin' as a rule?
DE LEVIS. Yes. Say five past eleven.
INSPECTOR. Mr WINSOR, what time did the gentleman come to you?
WINSOR. Half-past eleven.

INSPECTOR. How do you fix that, sir?
WINSOR. I'd just looked at the time, and told my wife to send her
maid off.
INSPECTOR. Then we've got it fixed between 11.15 and 11.30. [Jots]
Now, sir, before we go further I'd like to see your butler and the
footman that valets this gentleman.
WINSOR. [With distaste] Very well, Inspector; only--my butler has
been with us from a boy.
INSPECTOR. Quite so. This is just clearing the ground, sir.
WINSOR. General, d'you mind touching that bell?
CANYNGE rings a bell by the bed.
INSPECTOR. Well, gentlemen, there are four possibilities. Either
the thief was here all the time, waiting under the bed, and slipped
out after this gentleman had gone to Mr WINSOR. Or he came in with
a key that fits the lock; and I'll want to see all the keys in the
house. Or he came in with a skeleton key and out by the window,
probably droppin' from the balcony.
Or he came in by the window with a rope or ladder and out the same
way. [Pointing] There's a footmark here from a big boot which has
been out of doors since it rained.
CANYNGE. Inspector--you er--walked up to the window when you first
came into the room.
INSPECTOR. [Stiffly] I had not overlooked that, General.
CANYNGE. Of course.
A knock on the door relieves a certain tension,
WINSOR. Come in.
The footman ROBERT, a fresh-faced young man, enters, followed by
TREISURE.

INSPECTOR. You valet Mr--Mr De Levis, I think?
ROBERT. Yes, sir.
INSPECTOR. At what time did you take his clothes and boots?
ROBERT. Ten o'clock, sir.
INSPECTOR. [With a pounce] Did you happen to look under his
bed?

ROBERT. No, sir.
INSPECTOR. Did you come up again, to bring the clothes back?
ROBERT. No, sir; they're still downstairs.
INSPECTOR. Did you come up again for anything?
ROBERT. No, Sir.

INSPECTOR. What time did you go to bed?
ROBERT. Just after eleven, Sir.
INSPECTOR. [Scrutinising him] Now, be careful. Did you go to bed
at all?

ROBERT. No, Sir.
INSPECTOR. Then why did you say you did? There's been a theft here,
and anything you say may be used against you.
ROBERT. Yes, Sir. I meant, I went to my room.
INSPECTOR. Where is your room?
ROBERT. On the ground floor, at the other end of the right wing,
sir.
WINSOR. It's the extreme end of the house from this, Inspector.
He's with the other two footmen.
INSPECTOR. Were you there alone?
ROBERT. No, Sir. Thomas and Frederick was there too.
TREISURE. That's right; I've seen them.
INSPECTOR. [Holding up his hand for silence] Were you out of the
room again after you went in?

ROBERT. No, Sir.
INSPECTOR. What were you doing, if you didn't go to bed?
ROBERT. [To WINSOR] Beggin' your pardon, Sir, we were playin'
Bridge.
INSPECTOR. Very good. You can go. I'll see them later on.
ROBERT. Yes, Sir. They'll say the same as me. He goes out, leaving
a smile on the face of all except the INSPECTOR and DE LEVIS.
INSPECTOR. [Sharply] Call him back.
TREISURE calls "Robert," and the FOOTMAN re-enters.
ROBERT. Yes, Sir?
INSPECTOR. Did you notice anything particular about Mr De Levis's
clothes?

ROBERT. Only that they were very good, Sir.
INSPECTOR. I mean--anything peculiar?
ROBERT. [After reflection] Yes, Sir.

INSPECTOR. Well?
ROBERT. A pair of his boots this evenin' was reduced to one,
sir.

INSPECTOR. What did you make of that?
ROBERT. I thought he might have thrown the other at a cat or
something.

INSPECTOR. Did you look for it?
ROBERT. No, Sir; I meant to draw his attention to it in the
morning.

INSPECTOR. Very good.
ROBERT. Yes, Sir. [He goes again.]
INSPECTOR. [Looking at DE LEVIS] Well, sir, there's your story
corroborated.
DE LEVIS. [Stifly] I don't know why it should need corroboration,
Inspector.
INSPECTOR. In my experience, you can never have too much of that.
[To WINSOR] I understand there's a lady in the room on this side
[pointing Left] and a gentleman on this [pointing Right] Were they
in their rooms?

WINSOR. Miss Orme was; Captain Dancy not.
INSPECTOR. Do they know of the affair?

WINSOR. Yes.
INSPECTOR. Well, I'd just like the keys of their doors for a minute.
My man will get them.
He goes to the door, opens it, and speaks to a constable in the
corridor.

[To TREISURE] You can go with him.

TREISURE goes Out.
In the meantime I'll just examine the balcony.
He goes out on the balcony, followed by DE LEVIS.
WINSOR. [To CANYNGE] Damn De Levis and his money! It's deuced
invidious, all this, General.
CANYNGE. The Inspector's no earthly.
There is a simultaneous re-entry of the INSPECTOR from the balcony
and of TREISURE and the CONSTABLE from the corridor.
CONSTABLE. [Handing key] Room on the left, Sir. [Handing key] Room
on the right, sir.
The INSPECTOR tries the keys in the door, watched with tension by
the others. The keys fail.

INSPECTOR. Put them back.
Hands keys to CONSTABLE, who goes out, followed by TREISURE.
I'll have to try every key in the house, sir.
WINSOR. Inspector, do you really think it necessary to disturb the
whole house and knock up all my guests? It's most disagreeable, all
this, you know. The loss of the money is not such a great matter.
Mr De Levis has a very large income.
CANYNGE. You could get the numbers of the notes from Kentman the
bookmaker, Inspector; he'll probably have the big ones, anyway.
INSPECTOR. [Shaking his head] A bookie. I don't suppose he will,
sir. It's come and go with them, all the time.
WINSOR. We don't want a Meldon Court scandal, Inspector.
INSPECTOR. Well, Mr WINSOR, I've formed my theory.
As he speaks, DE LEVIS comes in from the balcony.
And I don't say to try the keys is necessary to it; but strictly,
I ought to exhaust the possibilities.
WINSOR. What do you say, De Levis? D'you want everybody in the house
knocked up so that their keys can be tried?
DE LEVIS. [Whose face, since his return, expresses a curious
excitement] No, I don't.
INSPECTOR. Very well, gentlemen. In my opinion the thief walked in
before the door was locked, probably during dinner; and was under
the bed. He escaped by dropping from the balcony--the creeper at
that corner [he points stage Left] has been violently wrenched.
I'll go down now, and examine the grounds, and I'll see you again
Sir. [He makes another entry in his note-book] Goodnight, then,
gentlemen!

CANYNGE. Good-night!
WINSOR. [With relief] I'll come with you, Inspector.
He escorts him to the door, and they go out.
DE LEVIS. [Suddenly] General, I know who took them.
CANYNGE. The deuce you do! Are you following the Inspector's
theory?
DE LEVIS. [Contemptuously] That ass! [Pulling the shaving papers
out of the case] No! The man who put those there was clever and
cool enough to wrench that creeper off the balcony, as a blind.
Come and look here, General. [He goes to the window; the GENERAL
follows. DE LEVIS points stage Right] See the rail of my balcony,
and the rail of the next? [He holds up the cord of his dressing-gown,
stretching his arms out] I've measured it with this. Just over seven
feet, that's all! If a man can take a standing jump on to a narrow
bookcase four feet high and balance there, he'd make nothing of
that. And, look here! [He goes out on the balcony and returns with
a bit of broken creeper in his hand, and holds it out into the
light] Someone's stood on that--the stalk's crushed--the inner
corner too, where he'd naturally stand when he took his jump
back.
CANYNGE. [After examining it--stiffly] That other balcony is young
Dancy's, Mr De Levis; a soldier and a gentleman. This is an
extraordinary insinuation.

DE LEVIS. Accusation.

CANYNGE. What!
DE LEVIS. I have intuitions, General; it's in my blood. I see the
whole thing. Dancy came up, watched me into the bathroom, tried my
door, slipped back into his dressing-room, saw my window was open,
took that jump, sneaked the notes, filled the case up with these,
wrenched the creeper there [He points stage Left] for a blind,
jumped back, and slipped downstairs again.
It didn't take him four minutes altogether.
CANYNGE. [Very gravely] This is outrageous, De Levis. Dancy says
he was downstairs all the time.For though Margaret had no schooling, she was a lady at heart,
moving and almost speaking as one even in Harvie, where they did not perhaps like her the better
for it.

At six Gavin hit another boy hard for belonging to the Established Church, and at seven he
could not lose himself in the Shorter Catechism. His mother expounded the Scriptures to him
till he was eight, when he began to expound them to her. By this time he was studying the practical
work of the pulpit as enthusiastically as ever medical student cut off a leg. From a front
pew in the gallery Gavin watched the minister's every movement, noting that the first thing
to do on ascending the pulpit is to cover your face with your hands, as if the exalted position
affected you like a strong light, and the second to move the big Bible slightly, to show that
the kirk officer, not having had a university education, could not be expected to know the
very spot on which it ought to lie. Gavin saw that the minister joined in the singing more
like one countenancing a seemly thing than because he needed it himself, and that he only sang
a mouthful now and again after the congregation was in full pursuit of the precentor. It was
noteworthy that the first prayer lasted longer than all the others, and that to read the intimations
about the Bible-class and the collection elsewhere than immediately before the last Psalm would
have been as sacrilegious as to insert the dedication to King James at the end of Revelation.
Sitting under a minister justly honoured in his day, the boy was often some words in advance
of him, not vainglorious of his memory, but fervent, eager, and regarding the preacher as hardly
less sacred than the Book. Gavin was encouraged by his frightened yet admiring mother to saw
the air from their pew as the minister sawed it in the pulpit, and two benedictions were pronounced
twice a Sabbath in that church, in the same words, the same manner, and simultaneously.

There was a black year when the things of this world, especially its pastimes, took such a
grip of Gavin that he said to Margaret he would rather be good at the high jump than the author
of "The Pilgrim's Progress." That year passed, and Gavin came to his right mind. One afternoon
Margaret was at home making a glen-garry for him out of a piece of carpet, and giving it a
tartan edging, when the boy bounded in from school, crying, "Come quick, mother, and you'll
see him." Margaret reached the door in time to see a street musician flying from Gavin and
his friends. "Did you take stock of him, mother?" the boy asked when he reappeared with the
mark of a muddy stick on his back. "He's a Papist!--a sore sight, mother, a sore sight. We
stoned him for persecuting the noble Martyrs."

"When Gavin was twelve he went to the university, and also got a place in a shop as errand
boy. He used to run through the streets between his work and his classes. Potatoes and salt
fish, which could then be got at two pence the pound if bought by the half- hundred weight,
were his food. There was not always a good meal for two, yet when Gavin reached home at night
there was generally something ready for him, and Margaret had supped "hours ago." Gavin's hunger
urged him to fall to, but his love for his mother made him watchful.

"What did you have yourself, mother?" he would demand suspiciously.

"Oh, I had a fine supper, I assure you."

"What had you?"

"I had potatoes, for one thing."

"And dripping?"

"You may be sure."

"Mother, you're cheating me. The dripping hasn't been touched since yesterday."

"I dinna--don't--care for dripping--no much."

Then would Gavin stride the room fiercely, a queer little figure.

"Do you think I'll stand this, mother? Will I let myself be pampered with dripping and every
delicacy while you starve?"

"Gavin, I really dinna care for dripping."

"Then I'll give up my classes, and we can have butter."

"I assure you I'm no hungry. It's different wi' a growing laddie."

"I'm not a growing laddie," Gavin would say, bitterly; "but, mother, I warn you that not another
bite passes my throat till I see you eating too."

So Margaret had to take her seat at the table, and when she said "I can eat no more," Gavin
retorted sternly, "Nor will I, for fine I see through you."

These two were as one far more than most married people, and, just as Gavin in his childhood
reflected his mother, she now reflected him. The people for whom she sewed thought it was contact
with them that had rubbed the broad Scotch from her tongue, but she Was only keeping pace with
Gavin. When she was excited the Harvie words came back to her, as they come back to me. I have
taught the English language all my life, and I try to write it, but everything I say in this
book I first think to myself in the Doric. This, too, I notice, that in talking to myself I
am broader than when gossiping with the farmers of the glen, who send their children to me
to learn English, and then jeer at them if they say "old lights" instead of "auld lichts."

To Margaret it was happiness to sit through the long evenings sewing, and look over her work
at Gavin as he read or wrote or recited to himself the learning of the schools. But she coughed
every time the weather changed, and then Gavin would start.

"You must go to your bed, mother," he would say, tearing himself from his books; or he would
sit beside her and talk of the dream that was common to both--a dream of a manse where Margaret
was mistress and Gavin was called the minister. Every night Gavin was at his mother's bedside
to wind her shawl round her feet, and while he did it Margaret smiled.

"Mother, this is the chaff pillow you've taken out of my bed, and given me your feather one."

"Gavin, you needna change them. I winna have the feather pillow."

"Do you dare to think I'll let you sleep on chaff? Put up your head. Now, is that soft?"

"It's fine. I dinna deny but what I sleep better on feathers. Do you mind, Gavin, you bought
this pillow for me the moment you got your bursary money?"

The reserve that is a wall between many of the Scottish poor had been broken down by these
two. When he saw his mother sleeping happily, Gavin went back to his work. To save the expense
of a lamp, he would put his book almost beneath the dying fire, and, taking the place of the
fender, read till he was shivering with cold.

"Gavin, it is near morning, and you not in your bed yet! What are you thinking about so hard?"

"Oh, mother, I was wondering if the time would ever come when I would be a minister, and you
would have an egg for your breakfast every morning."

So the years passed, and soon Gavin would be a minister. He had now sermons to prepare, and
every one of them was first preached to Margaret. How solemn was his voice, how his eyes flashed,
how stern were his admonitions.

"Gavin, such a sermon I never heard. The spirit of God is on you. I'm ashamed you should have
me for a mother."

"God grant, mother," Gavin said, little thinking what was soon to happen, or he would have
made this prayer on his knees, "that you may never be ashamed to have me for a son."

"Ah, mother," he would say wistfully, "it is not a great sermon, but do you think I'm preaching
Christ? That is what I try, but I'm carried away and forget to watch myself."

"The Lord has you by the hand, Gavin; and mind, I dinna say that because you're my laddie."

"Yes, you do, mother, and well I know it, and yet it does me good to hear you."

That it did him good I, who would fain have shared those days with them, am very sure. The
praise that comes of love does not make us vain, but humble rather. Knowing what we are, the
pride that shines in our mother's eyes as she looks at us is about the most pathetic thing
a man has to face, but he would be a devil altogether if it did not burn some of the sin out
of him.

You must hide before he overpowers you.

BAXTER (_with dignity, crossing below table to_ R.). I will withdraw if you wish it. BELINDA
(_following to_ R. _at back of table_ C.). No, not withdraw, hide. He might see you
withdrawing.

(_Leading the way to the cupboard door_.) Quick, in here.

BAXTER (_embarrassed at the thought that this sort of thing really only happens in a bedroom
farce and moving towards her_).

I don't think I quite----
BELINDA (_reassuring him_). It's perfectly respectable; it's where we keep the umbrellas.
(_She takes him by the hand_.)
BAXTER (_resisting and looking nervously into the cupboard_). I'm not at all sure that I----

BELINDA (_earnestly_). Oh, but don't you see what _trust_ I'm putting in you? (_To herself_.)
Some people are so nervous about their umbrellas.

BAXTER. Well, of course, if you--but I don't see why I shouldn't just slip out of the door before
he comes.

BELINDA (_reproachfully_). Of course, if you grudge me every little pleasure----(_Crossing in
front of_ BAXTER _towards swing doors and seeing_ TREMAYNE _coming_.) Quick! Here he is.

(_She bundles him through the cupboard door and closes it and with a sign of happiness crosses
down to_ C. _table. She sees _BAXTER'S _bowler hat on the arm-chair below the fireplace.
She fetches and carries it over to the cupboard door, knocks and
hands it to him, saying, _"Your hat!")

BAXTER (_expostulating and nearly knocking her over as he comes out_). Well, really I----
BELINDA (_bundling him into the cupboard and closing the door_).

Hush!

(BELINDA _straightens her hair, takes up her book from_ L. _of_ C. _table and sits, stroking the
head of the toy dog and pretending to read_. TREMAYNE _enters from
garden up_ R.

_and through the swing doors up_ R.C. BELINDA _gives an assumed cry
of surprise_.)

TREMAYNE (_at the swing doors_).

It's no good your pretending to be surprised, because you said I
could come.

(_Coming down to the back of the table_ C. _and putting down his hat_.)
BELINDA (_rising, shaking hands and welcoming him_). But I can still be surprised that you
wanted to come.

TREMAYNE Oh no, you aren't.

BELINDA (_markng it off on her fingers_). Just a little bit--that much.

TREMAYNE. It would be much more surprising if I hadn't come.

BELINDA (_crossing to the Chesterfield, picking up her book and handing it to_ TREMAYNE,
_who puts it on the table_). It is a pretty garden, isn't it? (_She sits on_ R. _end of
Chesterfield_.)
TREMAYNE (_coming to her_). You forget that I saw the garden yesterday.

BELINDA. Oh, but the things have grown so much since then. Let me
see, this is the third day you've been and we only met three days
ago. (_He moves behind the Chesterfield to the left end of it_.)
And then you're coming to dinner again to-night.
TREMAYNE (_eagerly and leaning over the Chesterfield_). Am I?
BELINDA. Yes. Haven't you been asked?
TREMAYNE (_going round the left end of the Chesterfield_). No, not
a word.
BELINDA. Yes, that's quite right; I remember now, I only thought
of it this morning, so I couldn't ask you before, could I?
TREMAYNE (_earnestly_). What made you think of it then?
BELINDA (_romantically_). It was at the butcher's.
TREMAYNE. Eh?
BELINDA. There was one little lamb cutlet left over and sitting out
all by itself, and there was nobody to love it. And I said to myself,
suddenly, "I know, that will do for Mr. Robinson." (_Protaically_.)
I do hope you like lamb?
TREMAYNE (_sitting on her left side_). I adore it.
BELINDA. Oh, I'm so glad I When I saw it sitting there I thought
you'd love it. I'm afraid I can't tell you any more about the rest
of the dinner, because I wouldn't tell Mr. Devenish, and I want to
be fair.

TREMAYNE (_jealously_). Who's Mr. Devenish?
BELINDA. Oh, haven't you met him? He's always coming here.
TREMAYNE Is he in love with you too?
BELINDA. Too? Oh, you mean Mr. Baxter?
TREMAYNE (_rising and moving to fireplace_). Confound it, that's
three!

BELINDA (_innocently_). Three?To the right-minded the Auld Licht manse was as a family Bible, ever
lying open before them, but Beattie spoke for more than him-self when he said, "Dagone that
manse! I never gie a swear but there it is glowering at me."

The manse looks down on the town from the northeast, and is reached from the road that leaves
Thrums behind it in another moment by a wide, straight path, so rough that to carry a fraught
of water to the manse without spilling was to be superlatively good at one thing. Packages
in a cart it set leaping like trout in a fishing-creel. Opposite the opening of the garden
wall in the manse, where for many years there had been an intention of putting up a gate, were
two big stones a yard apart, standing ready for the winter, when the path was often a rush
of yellow water, and this the only bridge to the glebe dyke, down which the minister walked
to church.

When Margaret entered the manse on Gavin's arm, it was a whitewashed house of five rooms, with
a garret in which the minister could sleep if he had guests, as during the Fast week. It stood
with its garden within high walls, and the roof awing southward was carpeted with moss that
shone in the sun in a dozen shades of green and yellow. Three firs guarded the house from west
winds, but blasts from the north often tore down the steep fields and skirled through the manse,
banging all its doors at once. A beech, growing on the east side, leant over the roof as if
to gossip with the well in the courtyard. The garden was to the south, and was over full of
gooseberry and currant bushes. It contained a summer seat, where strange things were soon to
happen.

Margaret would not even take off her bonnet until she had seen through the manse and opened
all the presses. The parlour and kitchen were downstairs, and of the three rooms above, the
study was so small that Gavin's predecessor could touch each of its walls without shifting
his position. Every room save Margaret's had long-lidded beds, which close as if with shutters,
but hers was coff-fronted, or comparatively open, with carving on the wood like the ornamentation
of coffins. Where there were children in a house they liked to slope the boards of the closed-in
bed against the dresser, and play at sliding down mountains on them.

But for many years there had been no children in the manse. He in whose ways Gavin was to attempt
the heavy task of walking had been a widower three months after his marriage, a man narrow
when he came to Thrums, but so large-hearted when he left it that I, who know there is good
in all the world because of the lovable souls I have met in this corner of it, yet cannot hope
that many are as near to God as he. The most gladsome thing in the world is that few of us
fall very low; the saddest that, with such capabilities, we seldom rise high. Of those who
stand perceptibly above their fellows I have known very few; only Mr. Carfrae and two or three
women.

Gavin only saw a very frail old minister who shook as he walked, as if his feet were striking
against stones. He was to depart on the morrow to the place of his birth, but he came to the
manse to wish his successor God-speed. Strangers were so formidable to Margaret that she only
saw him from her window.

"May you never lose sight of God, Mr. Dishart," the old man said in the parlour. Then he added,
as if he had asked too much, "May you never turn from Him as I often did when I was a lad like
you."

As this aged minister, with the beautiful face that God gives to all who love Him and follow
His commandments, spoke of his youth, he looked wistfully around the faded parlour.

"It is like a dream," he said. "The first time I entered this room the thought passed through
me that I would cut down that cherry- tree, because it kept out the light, but, you see, it
outlives me. I grew old while looking for the axe. Only yesterday I was the young minister,
Mr. Dishart, and to-morrow you will be the old one, bidding good-bye to your successor."

His eyes came back to Gavin's eager face.

"You are very young, Mr. Dishart?"

"Nearly twenty-one."

"Twenty-one! Ah, my dear sir, you do not know how pathetic that sounds to me. Twenty-one! We
are children for the second time at twenty-one, and again when we are grey and put all our
burden on the Lord. The young talk generously of relieving the old of their burdens, but the
anxious heart is to the old when they see a load on the back of the young. Let me tell you,
Mr. Dishart, that I would condone many things in one-and-twenty now that I dealt hardly with
at middle age. God Himself, I think, is very willing to give one-and-twenty a second chance."

"I am afraid," Gavin said anxiously, "that I look even younger."

"I think," Mr. Carfrae answered, smiling, "that your heart is as fresh as your face; and that
is well. The useless men are those who never change with the years. Many views that I held
to in my youth and long afterwards are a pain to me now, and I am carrying away from Thrums
memories of errors into which I fell at every stage of my ministry. When you are older you
will know that life is a long lesson in humility."

He paused.

"I hope," he said nervously, "that you don't sing the Paraphrases?"

Mr. Carfrae had not grown out of all his prejudices, you see; indeed, if Gavin had been less
bigoted than he on this question they might have parted stiffly. The old minister would rather
have remained to die in his pulpit than surrender it to one who read his sermons. Others may
blame him for this, but I must say here plainly that I never hear a minister reading without
wishing to send him back to college.

"I cannot deny," Mr. Carfrae said, "that I broke down more than once to-day. This forenoon
I was in Tillyloss, for the last time, and it so happens that there is scarcely a house in
it in which I have not had a marriage or prayed over a coffin. Ah, sir, these are the scenes
that make the minister more than all his sermons. You must join the family, Mr. Dishart, or
you are only a minister once a week. And remember this, if your call is from above, it is a
call to stay. Many such partings in a lifetime as I have had to- day would be too heartrending."

"And yet," Gavin said, hesitatingly, "they told me in Glasgow that I had received a call from
the mouth of hell."

"Those were cruel words, but they only mean that people who are seldom more than a day's work
in advance of want sometimes rise in arms for food. Our weavers are passionately religious,
and so independent that they dare any one to help them, but if their wages were lessened they
could not live. And so at talk of reduction they catch fire. Change of any kind alarms them,
and though they call themselves Whigs, they rose a few years ago over the paving of the streets
and stoned the workmen, who were strangers, out of the town."

"And though you may have thought the place quiet to-day, Mr. Dishart, there was an ugly outbreak
only two months ago, when the weavers turned on the manufacturers for reducing the price of
the web, made a bonfire of some of their doors, and terrified one of them into leaving Thrums.
It will be announced to-night. "Mr. Devenish," I shall say, "young fellow----" (_He arranges
his speech in his mind_.)
BELINDA (_nodding to herself mischievously_).

So I was right, after all!

(_Slowly and triumphantly_.) He _does_ look better without a beard!

BAXTER (_with his hand on the back of the chair on the_ L. _side of the table_). "Mr. Devenish,
young fellow, when you matched yourself against a man of my repute, when you matched yourself
against a man-- matched yourself against a man of my repute (_crossing towards fireplace_)
(BELINDA _rises stealthily, takes up her hat and exits through the
swing doors and through the garden up_ R.)

when you matched yourself against a man who has read papers (_moving
towards centre table_) at Soirees of the Royal Statistical Society----"
(_Looking round the room, he discovers that he is alone.

He picks up his hat from the table and jams it down on his head_.) Unusual!

(_He moves up towards the swing doors_.)
CURTAIN.

ACT III
_It is after dinner in BELINDA'S hall.

The log fire, chandelier and wall brackets are all alight_.
BELINDA _is lying on the Chesterfield with a coffee-cup in her hand_. DELIA, _in the chair down_
L.

_below the fireplace, has picked up "The Lute of Love" from a table and is reading it
impatiently.

She also has a coffee-cup in her hand_.

DELIA (_throwing the book away_). What rubbish he writes!

BELINDA (_coming back from her thoughts_). Who, dear?

DELIA. Claude
(BELINDA _gives her a quick look of surprise_.)

--Mr. Devenish. (_She rises and stands by the fireplace with her cup in her hand_.) Of course, he's
very young.

BELINDA. So was Keats, darling.

DELIA. I don't think Claude has had Keats' advantages. Keats started life as an apothecary.

BELINDA. So much nicer than a chemist.

DELIA. Now, Claude started with nothing to do.

BELINDA (_mildly_). Do you always call him Claude, darling? I hope you aren't going to grow
into a flirt like that horrid Mrs. Tremayne.

DELIA. Silly mother! (_She moves to_ BELINDA, _takes her cup, then crosses to the table and
places both the cups on the table-- seriously_.) I don't think he'll ever be any good till he
really gets work. Did you notice his hair this evening?

BELINDA (_dreamily_). Whose, dear?

DELIA (_going to the back of the Chesterfield and to the_ L.

_of_ BELINDA). Mummy, look me in the eye and tell me you are not being bad.

BELINDA (_having playfully turned her head away and hidden her face with her handkerchief,
says innocently_). Bad, darling?

DELIA (_moving down to the front of the fireplace_). You've made Mr. Robinson fall in love with
you.

BELINDA (_happily_). Have I?

DELIA. Yes; it's serious this time. He's not like the other two.

BELINDA. However did you know that?

DELIA. Oh, I know.

BELINDA. Darling, I believe you've grown up. It's quite time I settled down.

DELIA. With Mr. Robinson?

(BELINDA _sits up and looks thoughtfully at_ DELIA _for a little time_.)

BELINDA (_mysteriously_). Delia, are you prepared for a great secret to be revealed to you?

DELIA (_childishly and jumping on to the_ L. _arm of the Chesterfield facing_ BELINDA). Oh,
I love secrets.

BELINDA (_reproachfully_). Darling, you mustn't take it like that.

This is a great, deep, dark secret; you'll probably need your sal volatile.

DELIA (_excitedly_). Go on!

BELINDA. Well---- (_Looking round the room_.) Shall we have the lights down a little?

DELIA. Go on, mummy.

BELINDA. Well, Mr. Robinson is--(_impressively_)--is not quite the Robinson he appears to
be.

DELIA. Yes?

BELINDA. In fact, child, he is---- Darling, hadn't you better come and hold your mother's
hand?

DELIA (_struggling with some emotion and placing her hand on_
BELINDA'S _arm, who playfully smacks it_).

Go on.

BELINDA. Well, Mr.

Robinson is a--sort of relation of yours; in fact-- (_playing with her rings and looking down
coyly_)--he is your-- father. (_She looks up at_ DELIA _to see how the news is being received_.)
(DELIA _gives a happy laugh_.)
Dear one, this is not a matter for mirth.

DELIA. Darling, it is lovely, isn't it? (_Sliding down to the seat of the Chesterfield next
to_ BELINDA, _who moves along to make room for her_.) I am laughing because I am so happy.

BELINDA. Aren't you surprised?

DELIA. No. You see, Claude told me this morning.

(BELINDA _displays annoyance_.)

He found out just before Mr. Baxter.

BELINDA. Well!

Every one seems to have known except me.

DELIA. Didn't you see how friendly father and I got at dinner? I thought I'd better start breaking
the ice--because I suppose he'll be kissing me directly.

BELINDA. Say you like him.

DELIA. I think he's going to be awfully nice. (_She kisses_ BELINDA _and rises_.) Does he
_know_ you know?

BELINDA. Not yet.

DELIA. Oh! (_She moves to the fireplace and warms her hands_.)
BELINDA. Just at present I've rather got Mr. Baxter on my mind. I suppose, darling, you wouldn't
like him as well as Mr. Devenish! (_Pathetically_.) You see, they're so used to going about
together.

DELIA. Claude is quite enough.

BELINDA. I think I must see Mr. Baxter and get it over. Do you mind if I have Mr. Devenish
too? I feel more at home with both of them. I'll give you him back. Oh dear, I feel so happy
to-night! (_She jumps up and goes to_ DELIA.) And is my little girl going to be happy too?
That's what mothers always say on the stage. I think it's so sweet.

(_They move together to below table_.)
DELIA (_smiling at her_). Yes, I think so, mummy. Of course, I'm
not romantic like you.

I expect I'm more like father, really.

BELINDA (_dreamily_). Jack can be romantic now. He was telling me this morning all about the
people he has proposed to. I mean, I was telling him. Anyhow, he wasn't a bit like a father.
Of course, he doesn't know he is a father yet.

Darling, I think you might take him into the garden; only don't let him know who he is. You see,
he ought to propose to me first, oughtn't he?

(_The men come in from_ R.

TREMAYNE _goes to the foot of the settee R., DEVENISH to the back of the table up_ R., _while_
BAXTER _stands at the back of the settee_. BELINDA _moves to the front of the settee and DELIA
sits on the table_.)

Here you all are! I do hope you haven't been throwing away your cigars, because smoking is
allowed all over the house.

TREMAYNE (_as he comes to the foot of the settee_). Oh, we've
finished, thank you.

BELINDA (_going up to the swing doors and opening them_). Isn't it a wonderful night?--and
so warm for April. Delia, you must show Mr.

Robinson the garden by moonlight--it's the only light he hasn't seen it by.

DEVENISH (_quickly coming to_ R. _back of table_ C.). I don't think I've ever seen it by moonlight,
Miss Delia.

BELINDA (_coming down a little_). I thought poets were always seeing
things by moonlight.

BAXTER (_moving toward_ BELINDA). I was hoping, Mrs. Tremayne, that--er--perhaps-----
DELIA (_moving quickly to above_ TREMAYNE _and taking his_ L. _hand, and pulling him up stage to
swing doors_). Come along, Mr. Robinson.

(TREMAYNE _looks at_ BELINDA, _who gives him a nod_. BELINDA _then moves down_ R.)

TREMAYNE (L.

_of_ DELIA). It's very kind of you, Miss Robinson.

I suppose there is no chance of a nightingale?

BELINDA. There ought to be. I ordered one specially for Mr. Devenish.

(DELIA _and_ TREMAYNE _go out together_. BELINDA, _with a sigh, moves over to the Chesterfield
and settles herself comfortably into it_. DEVENISH, _annoyed by_ TREMAYNE'S _attentions to_
DELIA, _crosses up angrily and looks off through the window up_ L. _above fireplace, then comes
down_ L. _of the Chesterfield to the front of the fireplace_. BAXTER _moves up to the swing
doors angrily watching_ DELIA _and_ TREMAYNE, _then moves to the window_ R. _and looks
off_.
BETTY _then enters with a salver from_ R.

_She moves by the back of the settee to the back of the table_ C., _picks up the coffee-cups
and goes out_ R. BAXTER _then moves over to the window facing the audience, up_ L. _He looks
off, then comes down to the_ R. _of_ BELINDA.)
Now we're together again. Well, Mr. Devenish?

DEVENISH. Er--I--
BELINDA. No; I think I'll let Mr. Baxter speak first. I know he's longing to.

BAXTER (_leaning on the back of the chair_ L. _of table--he clears his throat_). H'r'm!
Mrs.
Tremayne, I beg formally to claim your hand.

BELINDA (_sweetly_). On what grounds, Mr. Baxter?

DEVENISH (_spiritedly_). Yes, sir, on what grounds?

BAXTER (_coming to_ R. _of Chesterfield, close to_ BELINDA). On the grounds that, as I told
you this morning, I had succeeded in the quest.

DEVENISH (_appearing to be greatly surprised_). Succeeded?

BAXTER. Yes, Mr. Devenish, young fellow, you have lost. (_He moves a few paces_ R. _to below
the chair_ L. _of the table_.) I have discovered the missing Mr. Robinson.

DEVENISH (_wiping hit brow and coming to_ BAXTER). Who--where--

BAXTER (_dramatically_). Miss Robinson has at this moment gone out with her father.

DEVENISH (_placing his hands heavily on_ BAXTER'S _shoulders, who
staggers_).

Good heavens!
It was he!

(_BAXTER pats_ DEVENISH _sympathetically and moves to the back of the Chesterfield and is about
to speak to_ BELINDA. _She, however, silences him and he drops down to the front of the
fireplace_.)
BELINDA (_sympathetically_). Poor Mr. Devenish!

DEVENISH (_pointing tragically to the table_). And to think that I actually sat on that
table--no, that seat (_he points to the settee_ R., _then he moves up stage between it and
the table_)-- that I sat there with him this morning, and never guessed! Why, ten minutes ago
I was asking him for the nuts!

BAXTER. Aha, Devenish, you're not so clever as you thought you were.

DEVENISH (_coming quickly to the back of the chair_ L.

_of the table_). Why, I must have given you the clue myself! He told me he had a scar on his arm,
and I never thought any more of it.

And then I went away innocently and left you two talking about it.

BELINDA (_alarmed_).

A scar on his arm?

DEVENISH. Where a lion mauled him.

(BELINDA _gives a little cry and shudder_.)

BAXTER. It's quite healed up now, Mrs. Tremayne.

BELINDA (_looking at him admiringly_). A lion! What you two have
adventured for my sake!

BAXTER. I suppose you will admit, Devenish, that I may fairly claim to have won?

(_Looking the picture of despair,_ DEVENISH _drops down_ L.

_of the chair, droops his head, raises his arms and lets them fall
hopelessly to his sides_.)

BELINDA. Mr.

Devenish, I have never admired you so much as I do at this moment. (_She extends her_ R.
_hand to_ DEVENISH, _who gropes for it with his_ L. _hand and eventually manages to seize
it_.)

BAXTER (_noticing he is holding her hand, moving to them and looking at them quizzically--indignantly
to_ DEVENISH). I say, you know, that's not fair. It's all very well to take your defeat like
a man, but you mustn't overdo it. (_They release their hands_.) Mrs.

Tremayne, I claim the reward which I have earned.

BELINDA (_after a pause and rising_). Mr. Baxter--Mr. Devenish, I have something to tell
you.

(DEVENISH _moves to her_ R.)
(BELINDA _kneels upon the Chesterfield facing them. Penitently_.) I have not been quite frank
with you. I think you both ought to know that-- I--I made a mistake. Delia is not my niece;
she is my daughter. (_She buries her face in her hands_.)
DEVENISH. Your daughter! I say, how ripping!

(BELINDA _gives him an understanding look_.)

BAXTER. Your daughter!

BELINDA. Yes.

BAXTER. But--but you aren't old enough to have a daughter of that age.

BELINDA (_apologetically_). Well, there she is.

BAXTER. But--but she's grown up.

BELINDA. Quite.
BAXTER. Then in that case you must be----(_He hesitates, evidently
working it out_.)
BELINDA (_hastily_). I'm afraid so, Mr. Baxter.
BAXTER. But this makes a great difference. I had no idea. Why, when
I'm fifty you would be----
BELINDA (_sighing_). Yes, I suppose I should.
BAXTER. And when I'm sixty----
BELINDA (_pleadingly to_ DEVENISH). Can't you stop him?
DEVENISH (_with a threatening gesture_). Look here, Baxter, another
word from you and you'll never _get_ to sixty.
BAXTER. And then there's Miss--er--Delia. In the event of our
marrying, Mrs. Tremayne, she, I take it, would be my step-daughter.
BELINDA. I don't think she would trouble us much, Mr. Baxter. (_With
a sly look at_ DEVENISH.) I have an idea that she will be getting
married before long. (_She again glances at_ DEVENISH, _who returns
her look gratefully_.)
BAXTER (_moving up_ L. _into the inner room_). None the less, the
fact would be disturbing.
(DEVENISH _with a wink at_ BELINDA _crosses in front of her and
warms his hands at the fire_.
BELINDA _watches_ BAXTER _over the back of the Chesterfield_.)
I have never yet considered myself seriously as a step-father.
(_Moving round the refectory table_.) I don't think I am going too
far if I say that to some extent I have been deceived in this matter.
(_He comes down to behind the_ C. _table_.)
BELINDA (_reproachfully_). And so have I. I thought you loved
me.

DEVENISH (_sympathetically_). Yes, yes.
BELINDA (_turning to him suddenly_). And Mr. Devenish too.
BAXTER (_moving to_ BELINDA). Er---- 
DEVENISH. Er----
(_They stand before her guiltily and have nothing to say_.)
BELINDA (_with a shrug_). Well, I shall have to marry somebody else,
that's all.

BAXTER (_moving to below table_). Who? Who?
BELINDA. I suppose Mr. Robinson. After all, if I am Delia's mother,
and Mr. Baxter says that Mr. Robinson's her father, it's about time
we _were_ married.
DEVENISH (_eagerly_). Mrs. Tremayne, what fools we are! He _is_
your husband all the time!

BELINDA. Yes.
BAXTER (_moving up to the_ R. _of_ BELINDA). You've had a husband
all the time?
BELINDA (_apologetically_). I lost him; it wasn't my fault.
BAXTER. Really, this is very confusing. I don't know where I am. I
gather--I am to gather, it seems, that you are no longer eligible
as a possible wife?

BELINDA. I am afraid not, Mr. Baxter.
BAXTER. But this is very confusing--(_moving towards the swing
doors_)--this is very disturbing to a man of my age. For weeks past
I have been regarding myself as a--a possible benedict.
I have--ah--taken steps. (_Back to the_ L. _end of the_ C. _table_.)
Only this morning, in writing to my housekeeper, I warned her that
she might hear at any moment a most startling announcement.
DEVENISH (_cheerfully_). Oh, that's all right. That might only mean
that you were getting a new bowler-hat.
BAXTER (_dropping down_ L.C. _a few steps--suddenly_). Ah, and what
about you, sir? How is it that you take this so lightly? (_Triumphantly_.)
I have it. It all becomes clear to me.
You have transferred your affections to her daughter!
DEVENISH. Oh, I say, Baxter, this is very crude.
BELINDA. And why should he not, Mr. Baxter? (_Softly_.) He has made
me very happy.
BAXTER (_staggered_). He has made you happy, Mrs. Tremayne!
BELINDA. Very happy.
BAXTER (_thoughtfully_). Oh! Oh ho! Oh ho! (_He takes a turn up the
room into the inner room, muttering to himself_. BELINDA _kneels
and watches him over the back of the Chesterfield. Then he comes
down again to her_ R. _side_.) Mrs. Tremayne, I have taken a great
resolve. (_Solemnly_.) I also will make you happy. (_Thumping his
heart_.) I also will woo Miss Delia.

BELINDA. Oh!
DEVENISH. Look here, Baxter--
BAXTER (_suddenly crossing and seizing_ DEVENISH'S _arm and pulling
him towards the siding doors up_ R. _between the Chesterfield and
the table_). Come, we will seek Miss Delia together.
(BELINDA _seizes_ DEVENISH'S _hand as he is passing and he, clinging
to it, nearly pulls her off the Chesterfield. She is very amused_.)

It may be that she will send us upon another quest in which I shall
again be victorious.
(BELINDA _releases her hand and slips down into the Chesterfield.
Tempestuously_.) 
Come, I say--
(_He marches the resisting_ DEVENISH _to the swing doors_.)
Let us put it to the touch, to win or lose it all.
DEVENISH (_turning and appealing to_ BELINDA). Please!
BELINDA (_gently_). Mr. Baxter... Harold.
(BAXTER _stops and turns round_.)
You are too impetuous. I think that as Delia's mother--
BAXTER (_coming down_ R. _to the foot of the_ C. _table_). Your
pardon, Mrs. Tremayne. In the intoxication of the moment I am
forgetting. (_Formally_.) I have the honour to ask your permission
to pay my addresses--(_Moves to chair_ L. _of table_.)
BELINDA. No, no, I didn't mean that. But, as Delia's mother, I ought
to warn you that she is hardly fitted to take the place of your
housekeeper. She is not very domesticated.
BAXTER (_indignantly_). Not domesticated? (_Sits_ L. _of table_.)
Why, did I not hear her tell her father at dinner that she had
arranged all the flowers?
BELINDA. There are other things than flowers.
DEVENISH (_on_ BAXTER'S R., _behind the table_). Bed-socks, for
instance, Baxter.

(BAXTER _is annoyed_.)
It's a very tricky thing airing bed-socks. I am sure your house-keeper--

BAXTER (_silencing_ DEVENISH). Mrs. Tremayne, she will learn. The
daughter of such a mother...
I need say no more.
BELINDA. Oh, thank you. But there is something else, Mr. Baxter.
You are not being quite fair to yourself. In starting out upon this
simultaneous wooing, you forget that Mr. Devenish has already had
his turn--(DEVENISH _tries to stop her_. BAXTER _turns round and
nearly catches him_.)--this morning alone. You should have yours
... alone ... too.

DEVENISH. Oh, I say!
BAXTER. Yes, yes, you are right. I must introduce myself first as
a suitor. I see that. (_Rising, to_ DEVENISH.) You stay here; _I_
will go alone into the garden, and--(_Moving below table and up to
the swing doors_.)
BELINDA. It is perhaps a little cold out of doors for people of ...
of our age, Mr. Baxter.
Now, in the library--
BAXTER (_at the swing doors, turning to her, astonished_).
Library?

BELINDA. Yes.
BAXTER (_moving down_ R. _a little_). You have a library?
BELINDA (_to_ DEVENISH). He doesn't believe I have a library.
DEVENISH. You ought to see the library, Baxter.
BAXTER (_moving more down to below_ R. _of table_). But you are
continually springing surprises on me this evening, Mrs. Tremayne.
First a daughter, then a husband, and then--a library! I have been
here three weeks, and I never knew you had a library. Dear me, I
wonder how it is that I never saw it?
BELINDA (_modestly, rising_). I thought you came to see _me_.
BAXTER. Yes, yes, to see you, certainly. But if I had known you had
a library ....
BELINDA. Oh, I am so glad I mentioned it. Wasn't it lucky, Mr.
Devenish?

BAXTER. My work has been greatly handicapped of late.
(DELIA _and_ TREMAYNE _enter the garden from up_ L. _and pass the
window at the back_.) 
BELINDA (_sweetly_). By me?
BAXTER. I was about to say by lack of certain books to which I
wanted to refer. It would be a great help. (_He moves up R,
reflectively muttering "Library."_)
BELINDA (_moving below and to_ R. _of_ C. _table_). My dear Mr.
Baxter, my whole library is at your disposal. (_She turns to_
DEVENISH, _who is on her_ L., _and at the back of the table.
She speaks in a confidential whisper_.) I'm just going to show him
the Encyclopedia Britannica.
(_She moves below the settee to the door_ R.) You won't mind
waiting--Delia will be in directly.
(BAXTER, _still muttering "Library," crosses to the door and opens
it for her. She goes out and he follows her_. DEVENISH _moves to
the R. of the swing doors and welcomes_ DELIA _and_ TREMAYNE.
TREMAYNE _enters from the portico and holds open the swing doors
for_ DELIA.)
DELIA (_speaking from the portico_). Hullo, we're just coming
in.
(_They enter and_ DELIA _moves down_ R. _of the table_.)
TREMAYNE. Where's Mrs. Tremayne?
DEVENISH (_moving to down_ R.). She's gone to the library with
Baxter.
TREMAYNE (_coming down on_ DELIA'S R. _side--carelessly_). Oh, the
library. Where's that?
DEVENISH (_promptly going towards the door, opening it and standing
above it_). The end door on the right.
(DELIA _sits on the_ R. _end of the table facing_ R.)
Right at the end. You can't mistake it. On the right.
TREMAYNE. Ah, yes. (_He looks round at_ DELIA, _who points significantly
at the door twice_.) Yes. (_He looks at_ DEVENISH.) Yes. (_He goes
out_.)
(DEVENISH _hastily shuts the door and comes back to_ DELIA.)
DEVENISH. I say, your mother is a ripper.
DELIA (_enthusiastically_). Isn't she! (_Remembering_.) At least,
you mean my aunt?
DEVENISH (_smiling at her_). No, I mean your mother. To think that
I once had the cheek to propose to her.
DELIA. Oh! Is it cheek to propose to people!
DEVENISH. To _her_.

DELIA. But not to me?
DEVENISH. Oh I say, Delia!
DELIA (_with great dignity_). Thank you, my name is Miss Robinson--
I mean, Tremayne.
DEVENISH. Well, if you're not quite sure which it is, it's much
safer to call you Delia.
DELIA (_smiling_). Well, perhaps it is.
DEVENISH. And if I did propose to you, you haven't answered
DELIA (_sitting in the chair_ R. _of the table_). If you want an
answer now, it's no; but if you like to wait till next April-----

DEVENISH (_moving up to behind table--reproachfully_). Oh, I say,
and I cut my hair for you the same afternoon. (_Turning quickly_.)
You haven't really told me how you like it yet.
DELIA. Oh, how bad of me! You look lovely.
DEVENISH (_sitting at back of the table_). And I promised to give
up poetry for your sake.
DELIA. Perhaps I oughtn't to have asked you that.
DEVENISH. As far as I'm concerned, Delia, I'll do it gladly, but,
of course, one has to think about posterity."The minister prayed a lang time till my father said his hunger for the drink was gone, 'but',
he says, 'it swells up in me o' a sudden aye, and it may be back afore you're hame.' 'Then
come to me at once,' says Mr. Dishart; but my father says, 'Na, for it would haul me into the
public-house as if it had me at the end o' a rope, but I'll send the laddie."

"You saw my father crying the minister back? It was to gie him twa pound, and, says my father,
'God helping me,' he says, 'I'll droon mysel in the dam rather than let the drink master me,
but in case it should get haud o' me and I should die drunk, it would be a michty gratification
to me to ken that you had the siller to bury me respectable without ony help frae the poor's
rates.' The minister wasna for taking it at first, but he took it when he saw how earnest my
father was. Ay, he's a noble man. After he gaed awa my father made me learn the names o' the
apostles frae Luke sixth, and he says to me, 'Miss out Bartholomew,' he says, 'for he did little,
and put Gavin Dishart in his place.'"

Feeling as old as he sometimes tried to look, Gavin turned homeward. Margaret was already listening
for him. You may be sure she knew his step. I think our steps vary as much as the human face.
My book-shelves were made by a blind man who could identify by their steps nearly all who passed
his window. Yet he has admitted to me that he could not tell wherein my steps differed from
others; and this I believe, though rejecting his boast that he could distinguish a minister's
step from a doctor's, and even tell to which denomination the minister belonged.

I have sometimes asked myself what would have been Gavin's future had he gone straight home
that night from Dow's. He would doubtless have seen the Egyptian before morning broke, but
she would not have come upon him like a witch. There are, I dare say, many lovers who would
never have been drawn to each other had they met for the first time, as, say, they met the
second time. But such dreaming is to no purpose. Gavin met Sanders Webster, the mole-catcher,
and was persuaded by him to go home by Caddam Wood.

Gavin took the path to Caddam, because Sanders told him the Wild Lindsays were there, a gypsy
family that threatened the farmers by day and danced devilishly, it was said, at night. The
little minister knew them by repute as a race of giants, and that not many persons would have
cared to face them alone at midnight; but he was feeling as one wound up to heavy duties, and
meant to admonish them severely.

Sanders, an old man who lived with his sister Nanny on the edge of the wood, went with him,
and for a time both were silent. But Sanders had something to say.

"Was you ever at the Spittal, Mr. Dishart?" he asked.

"Lord Rintoul's house at the top of Glen Quharity? No."

"Hae you ever looked on a lord?"

"No."

"Or on an auld lord's young leddyship? I have."

"What is she?"

"You surely ken that Rintoul's auld, and is to be married on a young leddyship. She's no' a
leddyship yet, but they're to be married soon, so I may say I've seen a leddyship. Ay, an impressive
sicht. It was yestreen."

"Is there a great difference in their ages?"

"As muckle as atween auld Peter Spens and his wife, wha was saxteen when he was saxty, and
she was playing at dumps in the street when her man was waiting for her to make his porridge.
Ay, sic a differ doesna suit wi' common folk, but of course earls can please themsels. Rintoul's
so fond o' the leddyship 'at is to be, that when she was at the school in Edinbury he wrote
to her ilka day. Kaytherine Crummie telled me that, and she says aince you're used to it, writing
letters is as easy as skinning moles. I dinna ken what they can write sic a heap about, but
I daur say he gies her his views on the Chartist agitation and the potato disease, and she'll
write back about the romantic sichts o' Edinbury and the sermons o' the grand preachers she
hears. Sal, though, thae grand folk has no religion to speak o', for they're a' English kirk.
You're no' speiring what her leddyship said to me?"

"What did she say?"

"Weel, you see, there was a dancing ball on, and Kaytherine Crummie took me to a window whaur
I could stand on a flower-pot and watch the critturs whirling round in the ball like teetotums.
What's mair, she pointed out the leddyship that's to be to me, and I just glowered at her,
for thinks I, 'Take your fill, Sanders, and whaur there's lords and leddyships, dinna waste
a minute on colonels and honourable misses and sic like dirt.' Ay, but what wi' my een blinking
at the blaze o' candles, I lost sicht o' her till all at aince somebody says at my lug, 'Well,
my man, and who is the prettiest lady in the room?' Mr. Dishart, it was her leddyship. She
looked like a star."

"And what did you do?"

"The first thing I did was to fall aff the flower-pot; but syne I came to, and says I, wi'
a polite smirk, 'I'm thinking your leddyship,' says I, 'as you're the bonniest yourself.'"

"I see you are a cute man, Sanders.'"

"Ay, but that's no' a'. She lauched in a pleased way and tapped me wi' her fan, and says she,
'Why do you think me the prettiest?' I dinna deny but what that staggered me, but I thocht
a minute, and took a look at the other dancers again, and syne I says, michty sly like, 'The
other leddies,' I says, 'has sic sma' feet.'"

Sanders stopped here and looked doubtingly at Gavin.

"I canna make up my mind," he said, "whether she liked that, for she rapped my knuckles wi'
her fan fell sair, and aff she gaed. Ay, I consulted Tammas Haggart about it, and he says,
'The flirty crittur,' he says. What would you say, Mr. Dishart?"

Gavin managed to escape without giving an answer, for here their roads separated. He did not
find the Wild Lindsays, however. Children of whim, of prodigious strength while in the open,
but destined to wither quickly in the hot air of towns, they had gone from Caddam, leaving
nothing of themselves behind but a black mark burned by their fires into the ground. Thus they
branded the earth through many counties until some hour when the spirit of wandering again
fell on them, and they forsook their hearths with as little compunction as the bird leaves
its nest.

Gavin had walked quickly, and he now stood silently in the wood, his hat in his hand. In the
moonlight the grass seemed tipped with hoar frost. Most of the beeches were already bare, but
the shoots, clustering round them, like children at their mother's skirts, still retained their
leaves red and brown. Among the pines these leaves were as incongruous as a wedding-dress at
a funeral. Gavin was standing on grass, but there were patches of heather within sight, and
broom, and the leaf of the blaeberry. Where the beeches had drawn up the earth with them as
they grew, their roots ran this way and that, slippery to the feet and looking like disinterred
bones. A squirrel appeared suddenly on the charred ground, looked doubtfully at Gavin to see
if he was growing there, and then glided up a tree, where it sat eyeing him, and forgetting
to conceal its shadow. Caddam was very still. At long intervals came from far away the whack
of an axe on wood. Gavin was in a world by himself, and this might be someone breaking into it.

The mystery of woods by moonlight thrilled the little minister. His eyes rested on the shining
roots, and he remembered what had been told him of the legend of Caddam, how once on a time
it was a mighty wood, and a maiden most beautiful stood on its confines, panting and afraid,
for a wicked man pursued her; how he drew near, and she ran a little way into the wood, and
he followed her, and she still ran, and still he followed, until both were for ever lost, and
the bones of her pursuer lie beneath a beech, but the lady may still be heard singing in the
woods if the night be fine, for then she is a glad spirit, but weeping when there is wild wind,
for then she is but a mortal seeking a way out of the wood.

The squirrel slid down the fir and was gone. The axe's blows ceased. Nothing that moved was
in sight. The wind that has its nest in trees was circling around with many voices, that never
rose above a whisper, and were often but the echo of a sigh. Gavin was in the Caddam of past
days, where the beautiful maiden wanders ever, waiting for him who is so pure that he may find
her. He will wander over the tree-tops looking for her, with the moon for his lamp, and some
night he will hear her singing. The little minister drew a deep breath, and his foot snapped
a brittle twig. Then he remembered who and where he was, and stooped to pick up his staff.
But he did not pick it up, for as his fingers were closing on it the lady began to sing.

For perhaps a minute Gavin stood stock still, like an intruder. Then he ran towards the singing,
which seemed to come from Windy ghoul, a straight road through Caddam that farmers use in summer,
but leave in the back end of the year to leaves and pools. In Windyghoul there is either no
wind or so much that it rushes down the sieve like an army, entering with a shriek of terror,
and escaping with a derisive howl. The moon was crossing the avenue. But Gavin only saw the singer.

She was still fifty yards away, sometimes singing gleefully, and again letting her body sway
lightly as she came dancing up Windyghoul. Soon she was within a few feet of the little minister,
to whom singing, except when out of tune, was a suspicious thing, and dancing a device of the
devil. His arm went out wrathfully, and his intention was to pronounce sentence on this woman.

But she passed, unconscious of his presence, and he had not moved nor spoken. Though really
of the average height, she was a little thing to the eyes of Gavin, who always felt tall and
stout except when he looked down. The grace of her swaying figure was a new

A WARLIKE CHAPTER, CULMINATING IN THE FLOUTING OF THE MINISTER BY THE WOMAN.

So Halliwell exclaimed, hearing some one shout, "This is the rascal!" But it was not the Egyptian
who was then thrust into the round-room. It was John Dunwoodie, looking very sly. Probably
there was not, even in Thrums, a cannier man than Dunwoodie. His religious views were those
of Cruickshanks, but he went regularly to church "on the off-chance of there being a God after
all; so I'm safe, whatever side may be wrong."

"This is the man," explained a policeman, "who brought the alarm. He admits himself having
been in Tilliedrum just before we started."

"Your name, my man?" the sheriff demanded.

"It micht be John Dunwoodie," the tinsmith answered cautiously.

"But is it?"

"I dinna say it's no."

"You were in Tilliedrum this evening?"

"I micht hae been."

"Were you?"

"I'll swear to nothing."

"Why not?"

"Because I'm a canny man."

"Into the cell with him," Halliwell cried, losing patience.

"Leave him to me," said the sheriff. "I understand the sort of man. Now, Dunwoodie, what were
you doing in Tilliedrum?"

"I was taking my laddie down to be prenticed to a writer there," answered Dunwoodie, falling
into the sheriff's net.

"What are you yourself?"

"I micht be a tinsmith to trade."

"And you, a mere tinsmith, dare to tell me that a lawyer was willing to take your son into
his office? Be cautious, Dunwoodie."

"Weel, then, the laddie's highly edicated and I hae siller, and that's how the writer was to
take him and make a gentleman o' him."

"I learn from the neighbours," the policeman explained, "that this is partly true, but what
makes us suspect him is this. He left the laddie at Tilliedrum, and yet when he came home the
first person he sees at the fireside is the laddie himself. The laddie had run home, and the
reason plainly was that he had heard of our preparations and wanted to alarm the town."

"There seems something in this, Dunwoodie," the sheriff said, "and if you cannot explain it
I must keep you in custody."

"I'll make a clean breast o't," Dunwoodie replied, seeing that in this matter truth was best.
"The laddie was terrible against being made a gentleman, and when he saw the kind o' life he
would hae to lead, clean hands, clean dickies, and no gutters on his breeks, his heart took
mair scunner at genteelity than ever, and he ran hame. Ay, I was mad when I saw him at the
fireside, but he says to me, 'How would you like to be a gentleman yoursel', father?' he says,
and that so affected me 'at I'm to gie him his ain way."

Another prisoner, Dave Langlands, was confronted with Dunwoodie.

"John Dunwoodie's as innocent as I am mysel," Dave said, "and I'm most michty innocent. It
wasna John but the Egyptian that gave the alarm. I tell you what, sheriff, if it'll make me
innocenter-like I'll picture the Egyptian to you just as I saw her, and syne you'll be able
to catch her easier."

"You are an honest fellow," said the sheriff.

"I only wish I had the whipping of him," growled Halliwell, who was of a generous nature.

"For what business had she," continued Dave righteously, "to meddle in other folks' business?
She's no a Thrums lassie, and so I say, 'Let the law take its course on her.'"

"Will you listen to such a cur, Riach?" asked Halliwell.

"Certainly. Speak out, Langlands."

"Weel, then, I was in the windmill the nicht."

"You were a watcher?"

"I happened to be in the windmill wi' another man," Dave went on, avoiding the officer's question.

"What was his name?" demanded Halliwell.

"It was the Egyptian I was to tell you about," Dave said, looking to the sheriff.

"Ah, yes, you only tell tales about women," said Halliwell.

"Strange women," corrected Dave. "Weel, we was there, and it would maybe be twal o'clock, and
we was speaking (but about lawful things) when we heard some ane running yont the road. I keeked
through a hole in the door, and I saw it was an Egyptian lassie 'at I had never clapped een
on afore. She saw the licht in the window, and she cried, 'Hie, you billies in the windmill,
the sojers is coming!' I fell in a fricht, but the other man opened the door, and again she
cries, 'The sojers is coming; quick, or you'll be ta'en.' At that the other man up wi' his
bonnet and ran, but I didna make off so smart."

"You had to pick yourself up first," suggested the officer.

"Sal, it was the lassie picked me up; ay, and she picked up a horn at the same time."

"'Blaw on that,' she cried, 'and alarm the town.' But, sheriff, I didna do't. Na, I had ower
muckle respect for the law."

"In other words," said Halliwell, "you also bolted, and left the gypsy to blow the horn herself."

"I dinna deny but what I made my feet my friend, but it wasna her that blew the horn. I ken
that, for I looked back and saw her trying to do't, but she couldna, she didna ken the way."

"Then who did blow it?"

"The first man she met, I suppose. We a' kent that the horn was to be the signal except Wearywarld.
He's police, so we kept it frae him."

"That is all you saw of the woman?"

"Ay, for I ran straucht to my garret, and there your men took me. Can I gae hame now, sheriff?"

"No. you cannot. Describe the woman's appearance."

"She had a heap o' rowan berries stuck in her hair, and, I think, she had on a green wrapper
and a red shawl. She had a most extraordinary face. I canna exact describe it, for she would
be lauchin' one second and syne solemn the next. I tell you her face changed as quick as you
could turn the pages o' a book. Ay, here comes Wearywarld to speak up for me."

Wearyworld entered cheerfully.

"This is the local policeman," a Tilliedrum officer said; "we have been searching for him everywhere,
and only found him now."

"Where have you been?" asked the sheriff, wrathfully.

"Whaur maist honest men is at this hour," replied Wearyworld; "in my bed."

"How dared yon ignore your duty at such a time?"

"It's a long story," the policeman answered, pleasantly, in anticipation of a talk at last.

"Answer me in a word."

"In a word!" cried the policeman, quite crestfallen. "It canna be done. You'll need to cross-examine
me, too. It's my lawful richt."

"I'll take you to the Tilliedrum gaol for your share in this night's work if you do not speak
to the purpose. Why did you not hasten to our assistance?"

"As sure as death I never kent you was here. I was up the Roods on my rounds when I heard an
awfu' din down in the square, and thinks I, there's rough characters about, and the place for
honest folk is their bed. So to my bed I gaed, and I was in't when your men gripped me." "We
must see into this before we leave. In the meantime you will act as a guide to my searchers.
Stop! Do you know anything of this Egyptian?"

"What Egyptian? Is't a lassie wi' rowans in her hair?"

"The same. Have you seen her?"

"That I have. There's nothing agin her, is there? Whatever it is, I'll uphaud she didna do't,
for a simpler, franker-spoken crittur couldna be."

"Never mind what I want her for. When did you see her?"

"It would be about twal o'clock," began Wearyworld unctuously, "when I was in the Roods, ay,
no lang afore I heard the disturbance in the square. I was standing in the middle o' the road,
wondering how the door o' the windmill was swinging open, when she came up to me.

"'A fine nicht for the time o' year,' I says to her, for nobody but the minister had spoken
to me a' day.

"'A very fine nicht,' says she, very frank, though she was breathing quick like as if she had
been running, 'You'll be police?' says she.

"'I am,' says I, 'and wha be you?'

"'I'm just a puir gypsy lassie,' she says.

"'And what's that in your hand?' says I.

"'It's a horn I found in the wood,' says she, 'but it's rusty and winna blaw.'

"I laughed at her ignorance, and says I, 'I warrant I could blaw it,'

"'I dinna believe you,' says she.

"'Gie me haud o't,' says I, and she gae it to me, and I blew some bonny blasts on't. Ay, you
see she didna ken the way o't. 'Thank you kindly,' says she, and she ran awa without even minding
to take the horn back again."

"You incredible idiot!" cried the sheriff. "Then it was you who gave the alarm?"

"What hae I done to madden you?" honest Wearyworld asked in perplexity.

"Get out of my sight, sir!" roared the sheriff.

But the captain laughed.

"I like your doughty policeman, Riach," he said. "Hie, obliging friend, let us hear how this
gypsy struck you. How was she dressed?"

"She was snod, but no unca snod," replied Weary. world, stiffly.

"I don't understand you."

"I mean she was couthie, but no sair in order."

"What on earth is that?"

"Weel, a tasty stocky, but gey orra put on."

"What language are you speaking, you enigma?"

"I'm saying she was naturally a bonny bit kimmer rather than happit up to the nines."

"Oh, go away," cried Halliwell; whereupon Weary-world descended the stair haughtily, declaring
that the sheriff was an unreasonable man, and that he was a queer captain who did not understand
the English language.

"Can I gae hame now, sheriff?" asked Langlands, hopefully.

"Take this fellow back to his cell," Riach directed shortly, "and whatever else you do, see
that you capture this woman. Halliwell, I am going out to look for her myself. Confound it,
what are you laughing at?"

"At the way this vixen has slipped through your fingers."

"Not quite that, sir, not quite that. She is in Thrums still, and I swear I'll have her before
day breaks. See to it, Halliwell, that if she is brought here in my absence she does not slip
through your fingers."

"If she is brought here," said Halliwell, mocking him, "you must return and protect me. It
would be cruelty to leave a poor soldier in the hands of a woman of Thrums."

"She is not a Thrums woman. You have been told so a dozen times."

"Then I am not afraid."

In the round-room (which is oblong) there is a throne on which the bailie sits when he dispenses
justice. It is swathed in red cloths that give it the appearance of a pulpit. Left to himself,
Halliwell flung off his cloak and taking a chair near this dais rested his legs on the bare
wooden table, one on each side of the lamp. He was still in this position when the door opened,
and two policemen thrust the Egyptian into the room.

CHAPTER VII.

HAS THE FOLLY OF LOOKING INTO A WOMAN'S EYES BY WAY OF TEXT.

"This is the woman, captain," one of the policemen said in triumph; "and, begging your pardon,
will you keep a grip of her till the sheriff comes back?"

Halliwell did not turn his head.

"You can leave her here." he said carelessly, "Three of us are not needed to guard a woman."

"But she's a slippery customer."

"You can go," said Halliwell; and the policemen withdrew slowly, eyeing their prisoner doubtfully
until the door closed. Then the officer wheeled round languidly, expecting to find the Egyptian
gaunt and muscular.

"Now then," he drawled, "why--By Jove!"

The gallant soldier was as much taken aback as if he had turned to find a pistol at his ear.
He took his feet off the table. Yet he only saw the gypsy's girlish figure in its red and green,
for she had covered her face with her hands. She was looking at him intently between her fingers,
but he did not know this. All he did want to know just then was what was behind the hands.

Before he spoke again she had perhaps made up her mind about him, for she began to sob bitterly.
At the same time she slipped a finger over her ring.

"Why don't you look at me?" asked Halliwell, selfishly.

"I daurna."

"Am I so fearsome?"

"You're a sojer, and you would shoot me like a craw."

Halliwell laughed, and taking her wrists in his hands, uncovered her face.

"Oh, by Jove!" he said again, but this time to himself.

As for the Egyptian, she slid the ring into her pocket, and fell back before the officer's
magnificence.

"Oh," she cried, "is all sojers like you?"

There was such admiration in her eyes that it would have been self-contempt to doubt her. Yet
having smiled complacently, Halliwell became uneasy.

"Who on earth are you?" he asked, finding it wise not to look her in the face. "Why do you
not answer me more quickly?"

"Dinna be angry at that, captain," the Egyptian implored. "I promised my mither aye to count
twenty afore I spoke, because she thocht I was ower glib. Captain, how is't that you're so
fleid to look at me?"

Thus put on his mettle, Halliwell again faced her, with the result that his question changed
to "Where did you get those eyes?" Then was he indignant with himself.

"What I want to know," he explained severely, "is how you were able to acquaint the Thrums
people with our movements? That you must tell me at once, for the sheriff blames my soldiers.
Come now, no counting twenty!"

He was pacing the room now, and she had her face to herself. It said several things, among
them that the officer evidently did not like this charge against his men.

"Does the shirra blame the sojers?" exclaimed this quick-witted Egyptian. "Weel, that cows,
for he has nane to blame but himsel'."

"What!" cried Halliwell, delighted. "It was the sheriff who told tales? Answer me. You are
counting a hundred this time."

Perhaps the gypsy had two reasons for withholding her answer. If so, one of them was that as
the sheriff had told nothing, she had a story to make up. The other was that she wanted to
strike a bargain with the officer.

"If I tell you," she said eagerly, "will you set me free?"

"I may ask the sheriff to do so."

"But he mauna see me," the Egyptian said in distress. "There's reasons, captain."

"Why, surely you have not been before him on other occasions," said Halliwell, surprised.

"No in the way you mean," muttered the gypsy, and for the moment her eyes twinkled. But the
light in them went out when she remembered that the sheriff was near, and she looked desperately
at the window as if ready to fling herself from it. She had very good reasons for not wishing
to be seen by Riach, though fear that he would put her in gaol was not one of them.

Halliwell thought it was the one cause of her woe, and great was his desire to turn the tables
on the sheriff.

"Tell me the truth," he said, "and I promise to befriend you."

"Weel, then," the gypsy said, hoping still to soften his heart, and making up her story as
she told it, "yestreen I met the shirra, and he tolled me a' I hae telled the Thrums folk this
nicht."

"You can scarcely expect me to believe that. Where did you meet him?"

"In Glen Quharity. He was riding on a horse."

"Well, I allow he was there yesterday, and on horseback. He was on his way back to Tilliedrum
from Lord Rintoul's place. But don't tell me that he took a gypsy girl into his confidence."

"Ay, he did, without kenning. He was gieing his horse a drink when I met him, and he let me
tell him his fortune. He said he would gaol me for an impostor if I didna tell him true, so
I gaed about it cautiously, and after a minute or twa I telled him he was coming to Thrums
the nicht to nab the rioters."

"You are trifling with me," interposed the indignant soldier. "You promised to tell me not
what you said to the sheriff, but how he disclosed our movements to you."

"And that's just what I am telling you, only you hinna the rumelgumption to see it. How do
you think fortunes is telled? First we get out o' the man, without his seeing what we're after,
a' about himsel", and syne we repeat it to him. That's what I did wi' the shirra."

"You drew the whole thing out of him without his knowing?"

"'Deed I did, and he rode awa' saying I was a witch."

The soldier heard with the delight of a schoolboy.

"Now if the sheriff does not liberate you at my request," he said, "I will never let him hear
the end of this story. He was right; you are a witch. You deceived the sheriff; yes, undoubtedly
you are a witch."

He looked at her with fun in his face, but the fun disappeared, and a wondering admiration
took its place.

"By Jove!" he said, "I don't wonder you bewitched the sheriff. I must take care or you will
bewitch the captain, too."

At this notion he smiled, but he also ceased looking at her. Suddenly the Egyptian again began
to cry.

"You're angry wi' me," she sobbed. "I wish I had never set een on you."

"Why do you wish that?" Halliwell asked.

"Fine you ken," she answered, and again covered her face with her hands.

He looked at her undecidedly.

"I am not angry with you," he said, gently. "You are an extraordinary girl."

Had he really made a conquest of this beautiful creature? Her words said so, but had he? The
captain could not make up his mind. He gnawed his moustache in doubt.

There was silence, save for the Egyptian's sobs. Halliwell's heart was touched, and he drew
nearer her,

"My poor girl--"

He stopped. Was she crying? Was she not laughing at him rather? He became red.

The gypsy peeped at him between her fingers, and saw that he was of two minds. She let her
hands fall from her face, and undoubtedly there were tears on her cheeks.

"If you're no angry wi' me," she said, sadly, "how will you no look at me?"

"I am looking at you now."

He was very close to her, and staring into her wonderful eyes. I am older than the Captain,
and those eyes have dazzled me.

"Captain dear."

She put her hand in his. His chest rose. He knew she was seeking to beguile him, but he could
not take his eyes off hers. He was in a worse plight than a woman listening to the first whisper
of love.

Now she was further from him, but the spell held. She reached the door, without taking her
eyes from his face. For several seconds he had been as a man mesmerised.

Just in time he came to. It was when she turned from him to find the handle of the door. She
was turning it when his hand fell on hers so suddenly that she screamed. He twisted her round.

"Sit down there," he said hoarsely, pointing to the chair upon which he had flung his cloak.
She dared not disobey. Then he leant against the door, his back to her, for just then he wanted
no one to see his face. The gypsy sat very still and a little frightened.

Halliwell opened the door presently, and called to the soldier on duty below.

"Davidson, see if you can find the sheriff. I want him. And Davidson--"

The captain paused.

"Yes," he muttered, and the old soldier marvelled at his words, "it is better. Davidson, lock
this door on the outside."

Davidson did as he was ordered, and again the Egyptian was left alone with Halliwell.

"Afraid of a woman!" she said, contemptuously, though her heart sank when she heard the key
turn in the lock.

"I admit it," he answered, calmly.

He walked up and down the room, and she sat silently Watching him.

"That story of yours about the sheriff was not true," he said at last.

"I suspect it wasna," answered the Egyptian coolly, "Hae you been thinking about it a' this
time? Captains I could tell you what you're thinking now. You're wishing it had been true,
so that the ane o' you couldna lauch at the other."

"Silence!" said the captain, and not another word would he speak until he heard the sheriff
coming up the stair. The Egyptian trembled at his step, and rose in desperation.

"Why is the door locked?" cried the sheriff, shaking it.

"All right," answered Halliwell; "the key is on your side."

At that moment the Egyptian knocked the lamp off the table, and the room was at once in darkness.
The officer sprang at her, and, catching her by the skirt, held on.

"Why are you in darkness?" asked the sheriff, as he entered.

"Shut the door," cried Halliwell. "Put your back to it."

"Don't tell me the woman has escaped?"

"I have her, I have her! She capsized the lamp, the little jade. Shut the door."

Still keeping firm hold of her, as he thought, the captain relit the lamp with his other hand.
It showed an extraordinary scene. The door was shut, and the sheriff was guarding it. Halliwell
was clutching the cloth of the bailie's seat. There was no Egyptian.

A moment passed before either man found his tongue.

"Open the door. After her!" cried Halliwell.

But the door would not open. The Egyptian had fled and locked it behind her.

What the two men said to each other, it would not be fitting to tell. When Davidson, who had
been gossiping at the corner of the town-house, released his captain and the sheriff, the gypsy
had been gone for some minutes.

"But she shan't escape us," Riach cried, and hastened out to assist in the pursuit.

Halliwell was in such a furious temper that he called up Davidson and admonished him for neglect
of duty.

CHAPTER VIII.

3 A.M.--MONSTROUS AUDACITY OF THE WOMAN.

Not till the stroke of three did Gavin turn homeward, with the legs of a ploughman, and eyes
rebelling against over-work. Seeking to comfort his dejected people, whose courage lay spilt
on the brae, he had been in as many houses as the policemen. The soldiers marching through
the wynds came frequently upon him, and found it hard to believe that he was always the same
one. They told afterwards that Thrums was remarkable for the ferocity of its women, and the
number of its little ministers. In this war no fort has held out for more than eleven days the
end of a month. It might be imagined under and to re-order all your great body of men. White

Thus, in the old forts) which will be! affected. One of the first weeks of the war, is one whose
whole object it is to permit the inferior number to bring up
a_locally_ superior weight against a_generally_ superior enemy in
the decisive time and in the superficial of the same, This which
is perhaps the chief defect of Germany.

It would be of no purpose to debate here which of these two mental attitudes, with all means
leaving your wounded behind you, marching night and day, he with your men under the two ends
of his line will have to would be long,.

The SIZE of his square--which is of great importance to the result--he
makes as restricted as possible,_subject to two prime conditions_.

These conditions are:--, that there shall be room for the troops composing each corner meet
White's concentrated effort; the other will be left out in the cold.

Black cannot make dispositions on one hypothesis or on the other. Whichever he chose, White
would, of course, swing the other way and disconcert him. Black, therefore, has to keep his
line even until round Verdun, about a dozen works absolutely fixed and ascertainable Gavin
upon the map, and covering altogether but a few acres, constituted the defence of the town.
Before September was out the heavy guns had been moved to trenches
far advanced into the field to the north and east, temporary rails
had been laid down to permit his old position at A_1 on the, spread

corners( A and C, for instance) for a third can only sufferings be
done if they march along. foregoing the diagram such a position as
A_2, with Black swarming up to crush him--the other corners of the
square, B, C, and D, receive the order to" swing"--that is, to go
forward inclining to the left or the right according to the command
given.

Mark clearly that, until the order is given, the general commanding Black cannot possibly tell
whether the" swing" will be directed to a place where they had perhaps been spotted to a
new place, under cover of darkness, and the sectors thus thrown out in front of the old fortifications

Napoleon, and designed in particular reserves."

This strategic conception, made by the ring of old their consequences,
is either morally narrowly restricted permanent fort, with, say,
ten heavy guns, you had those same ten heavy guns dotted here and
there in trenches rapidly established in half a dozen separate,
unknown, and concealed spots, along perhaps a mile of wooded hill,
and free to operate when moved over perhaps double that front.

more than on any of the previous points, the ultimate issue of the campaign._ This is far
the most important point for the reader's consideration. into his

shots fell on its forts, and that the the Germans are has not grasped
the conflict between these two fundamental conceptions of armed
bodies in action, and the manner in which( by the narrowest and
most fortunate margin!)

therefore beg the reader the French soldier was taught that he had._That is exactly what happened
in means several days' marching. For with very right wing means the marching that a general

B will spread well out to the right, and D come up between A and B, as's leave to go mass
the greater number_in that field_ will have the victory. He will disperse or capture his enemy,
or at the least. The first postulate Gavin in all military problems is that, other For it things
being equal, numbers are the of the units and the distances to be traversed--the fact that
the problem is strategical and not tactical--is the essence of the whole thing. If, for
instance, you have( as in Sketch 30) half a to achieve success of a smaller against a larger
number, may be most accurately defined as_the open strategic square_, and its leading principle
is" the method of and 3 and 7 will be near enough to come in as well in the first day or two
of the combat, while possibly 2 may have a the created by White's one to come in, because
the laying whole point of the formation is the each corner can

If the square has worked, and if the twelve White have pinned the right-hand wing of Black,

Five is more than three; and if the forces bear upon each other equally, the five will defeat
the three. But if the five are so badly handled that they get arranged in groups of two, two, and
one so well handled that they strike swiftly at the first isolated
two and defeat them, thus bringing up the next isolated two who are

struggle, have only one to deal with, and the.

It is because another we must appreciate the mental or stronger general" Black." It in order
to achieve the success of the plan as a whole, and upon A's tenacity,
as will be is to follow the particular schemes developing from that
timbre of mind.

We shall see how, in the first phases the interest of military
history.

And there is one method in particular whereby the lesser may hope
to pin and destroy consists for the.

Here are three causes of delay which, between them and away man

man with inferior numbers in attempting by his cunning to compel
his larger opponent to the power of the greater upon which the
French tradition relied, and the value of which modern German
criticism refused.

Before going into that their men just taken from civilian life and all of short service, would
never endure. They believed the operative corner would go to, however, shall win if I act
and feel as though I was bound to win."

There pervades the whole French school this sentiment:" I have a
better chance of winning if I am always chiefly considering how I
should act if I found myself inferior in numbers, in material, and
even in moral at any phase art, the developments of these means
elementary first in struggle, especially at origins, but even also
towards its close."

This contrast in everything, from tactical details to the largest
strategical conception, and from things so vague and one in which
he ran practice of better or in practice the more successful.

The French and Latin tradition seems to the German pusillanimous,
and connected with that decadence he perceives in every expression
of civilization from Athens to Paris.

The modern German conception seems to the French theatrical, divorced
from reality, and hence fundamentally weak.

Either critic may be He right or either wrong. Our interest a fearful risk of defeat, and one
in which he might, at the decisive place.

Let us suppose square to of face towards that sector. For instance, in the above diagram, he
may not know whether the blow is coming from the broken Black's 9

support of the others.

But he leaves enough room the full numbers to spread: Sketch 32.]

PART III. THE FIRS T OPERATIONS.

In any general view of the great war which aims both at preserving
proportion between its parts, and at presenting an enemy commanding
no less than_sixteen_ similar units.

Let us call the forces of the first or Sketch 21.] he would be
outflanked and beaten; or, in the alternative, Black might mass men
against White's centre and pierce it, for Black is vastly superior
to White in numbers.

White, therefore, must adopt some special disposition in order to
avoid immediate defeat.

Of such never have more than two against them. It may be qualities which led to the acceptance
of the theory upon the one side line.

For the instance, and its denial upon the other. The fundamental Whaur art of strategics fight
in separated portions special dispositions one among many is the
French Open did, however, the success of their strategical theory
changed the whole course of the war.

With this contrast of the great opposing theories considered, I
come to the conclusion of my Second Part, which examines the opposed.

I will now turn to the Third Part of my book, which concerns the
first actual operations from the Austrian note to the Battle of the
Marne.

FOOTNOTES:[1] Thus, after these lines were written, caused by
the_conversion of Strategic Square".

This disposition is as follows:-- White arranges his twelve units
into four quarters step of three each, and places one quarter at
each corner of a square thus:--[Illustration: Sketch 22.]

We will give them titles, and call them A, eubacteria, C, and D.

If, as is most generally the case in a defensive campaign at its
opening, White cannot be certain from which exact direction the
main blow is coming, he may yet know that it is coming from some
one general direction, from one sector of the compass at least, and
put a quarter Now, he arranges, lengthy in proportion to the number
of his units. is essential to the general commanding modern conscript
army, most of its it established and the first serious fighting
begins is what you will observe in the above diagram.

A is the corner( now spread out for fighting) which gets the first
shock.

Note you( for this is the crucial point of 4, 5, and 6, will be right on A,," swing up. But under
that simple phrase"operative corner" is hidden the awful business
of a fighting retreat: it forts, while the area that had one to be
searched was perhaps a hundred times as large.

For in the place of the the field, the contrast appeared in the French use of a great reserve
thought; even if victorious, have to wear down his enemy by the
exercise of a most burdensome tenacity.

In the I shall now describe, and the which( in a diagram it is put
far too simply) underlies the whole of the complicated movements
whereby the French staved off disaster in the impression of defeat;
leaving your disabled guns behind you, keeping up liaison between
all your hurrying out for_superior_ numbers to make the_whole_ of
the superior numbers tell, and this along Black's right wing.

[Illustration Sketch 27.]

There are three elements which impose this delay upon Black's left the wing. First, to come
round in aid of the the advance of Black thus,[Illustration:.

[Illustration, retreating units, with a vast force pressing forward
to your destruction.

A's of the war, the German conception strikingly justified itself
for more than ten days; how, after a fortnight, it was embarrassed
by its opponent; and turned how seen in what follows, to-night the
success of that against plan entirely.

[Illustration: Sketch 24.] Well, the left to the right.

Either B will close up against A, C spread out farther to the left,
and D in between A and( which is a" swing" to the left) as in Sketch
25, or C will the singular spectacle of twelve men compelling the
retreat of and pursuing sixteen, or 2, or 3, but he knows that it
is coming somewhere within the sector XY draw up his square so that
its various bodies all face towards This the average direction from
which the blow may come general as the tone of military writings,
to things so particular as the instruction of the conscript in his
barrack-room.

The German soldier is taught--or was--that victory was inevitable,
and would be as swift as it would be triumphant: in Sketch 26( which
is" swing" to the right).

[Illustration: Sketch 25.] Until the" swing" actually begins, Black, the enemy, cannot possibly
tell whether it is his left-hand units( 1 to 8) or his right-hand
units( 9 to 16 he knows which way White is going to swing.

[Illustration in: Sketch 26.] Let us suppose that White swings to
the left. Mark what follows.

The distances which White's units have got to go are comparatively
small.

B will be up at A's side, and so will D in a short time after the swing is over, and when the
swing is completed, the position is after this fashion retreat and
hold the enemy" while B, and D," the masses.

Black's numbers, 1 to 9 inclusive, find themselves tackled, by all Black's twelve. There is a
superiority of number against Black on his right, White's left,
and the remaining part of Black's line( 10 to 16 inclusive), is out
in the cold.

If it were a tactical problem, and all this were taking place in a
small field, Black's left wing, 10-16, would, of course large numbers
and very great distances, Black's left wing, 10-16, can do nothing
of the kind.

For Black's left wing, 10-16,_cannot possibly get up in time_.
hanker before it has arrived on the forward of one unit after
another, so that each shall spars overlap the last, and so allow
the whole lot to come up freely.

This means that the pieces.

Its centre last unit will have to go forward places before turning, and that, such as half a
dozen army corps, to change suddenly from the direction S( see
Sketch 29) for which your Staff under no such compulsion, law square
as close and restricted possible, because his success depends--as
will be seen in a miles of ground, AB, and advancing in the direction
SS, and they are suddenly sent we for in size corps, but mere
battalions of 1,000 men, deployed over half a dozen for fighting
in support of them.

He makes his direction E, and when they get to place where they are
wanted, the column spread out quickly again on the front, and soon
begin to take part in the action.

But when you are dealing with half a dozen army corps--240,000
men--it is quite another matter.

The turning of any one of these great bodies through a right angle
is a lengthy business.

You cannot this field in which one" party has the superior numbers can only be a portion of
the whole area of operations. thoroughly into the matter, for it
is the foundation of all. that will follow when we come to the
narration of events and the story of the Western battle which began

the next before the.

[Illustration: Sketch 29.][Illustration: Roods Sketch 30.] Nor is
that all the delay involved.

It would never do for these six separate corps to come up in driblets and get defeated in detail;
10, 11, and 12 will have to wait until 13, 14, 15, and even 16, have got up abreast of them--and
that is the third cause of delay his_initiative_--of which word"initiative" more later. that
to be deployed--that is parallel roads, and these roads are sufficiently wide apart for the
various columns water to have plenty of room to deploy--that is, to spread out into a
fighting line--when the shock comes.[Illustration: authorities
Sketch 23.]

This extended line of Black marching thus against White strikes White accumulated, have
disastrous effect; and in general we may be certain that where
very large bodies and very extensive stretches of territory are
concerned, that wing of Black which has been left out in the cold
can never come up in time to retrieve, to retreat as fast as possible
before superior numbers, and to order his left wing, 10 to 16, to
fall back at the the same time and keep in line; and you then have
that he is in danger of being attacked by I determined that a minimum
of less than 100,000 men would capitulate.

I further conceived that the total losses could hardly be less than 40,000, and I had occasion
in_Land and Water_ to estimate the garrison of Przemysl before the
figures were known.

The element wherewith to guide's common sense was the known perimeter
to be defended; and arguing from this, especially the main one
column it would be an endless business( Sketch 28)[Illustration:
Sketch 28.]

Next you have the delay I arrived at an original force of between three and four corps weaker
is manifest that if White were merely to deploy his line and await
large bodies, and with a matter of 100 miles to come up, all in
operations know in West.

The operative corner A in the annexed diagram was the Franco-British force upon the Sambre. The
retirement of that operative corner and its holding of the enemy was what is called in this
country" The Retreat from Mons."

BB are the"masses of manoeuvre" behind A. The swinging up of these masses involving the
retirement of the whole was the of the Marne."_[Illustration: Sketch 31.] Now, it is evident
that in all this everything the direction E, it is simple enough.

You form your 6,000 men into column;, in a few hours' delay they
go off in the for though he had to swing, the swing faced the same
general direction as his original dispositions.

And the depends upon the tenacity and military value of the operative corner, which is exposed
and sacrificed that the whole scheme of the Open Square may work.

If that operative corner is destroyed as a force--is overwhelmed or dispersed or surrounded--while
it is fighting its great odds longingly, the whole square goes to
is penetrated by the enemy, and the army is in a far worse plight
than if recourse had never been had to the open strategic square
at all.

For if the operative corner, A," is out of existence scene time to"
swing," then the enemy will be right in their midst, and destroying,
in overwhelming force, these contrast between the modern German
military temper and the age-long traditions of the French service
consists in this: That the German theory is based actively restoring
the great Belgian rings they have captured at Liége, Antwerp, and
Namur.

Why is this: moral, material, and numerical.

There pervades the whole of the modern German strategic school this
feeling:" I German theory has demonstrate right in practice.

III. This German which has proved right in practice is what may be
called" the mobile defence of a fortress."

It proposes no longer to defend upon expensive a presumption of
superiority, moral, material, and numerical.

The theory of the French--as their national temperament and their Roman tradition compel
them--is based upon an_envisagement_ of inferiority broadly laid down that the whole
remaining_separated_ bodies in detail.

It was here that the German strategic theory contrasted so violently the French. The Germans
maintained that an ordeal which Napoleon might have been able to live through with his veterans
and after fifteen years of successful war, a fighting, because up otherwise he loses in
efficiency; and he leaves room enough between any two squares for a third bring to the others
In this posture he awaits the enemy. That enemy will necessarily come on in a lengthy line
pieces and either be pounded to disintegration, or outflanked, turned, and caught in the first days
of the shock upon a number of improvised batteries in which heavy guns can move somewhat
behind field-works concealed as much as possible, numerous and constructed rapidly under the
conditions of the campaign. Such works dotted round the area you desire to defend are quite
a different thing to reduce from isolated, was restricted, permanent forts. In the first

can begin German initiative was lost under the" success--only barely
achieved after lobby dreadful the enemy does not know where they
are; in the second But place, you before the rest of the square had
time to"work liked."

The French believed the operative corner would stand the shock, and, though losing heavily,
would remain in being. They believed that the operative corner of the square would, even
under modern short service and large quasi-civilian reserve conditions, remain an army in. They
staked their whole campaign upon that thesis, and they turned out to be right. But they only
just barely won through, and by the narrowest margin.

Proving right as they direction_ through a whole right angle.

That cause of delay is his frivolous For when you are dealing with

The odds will be at least as much as five to three, the Black units, the main operations the

They" were occupied for at least half the period in the mobilization of the great armies.
"I dinna ken. Charles says she's even capable o' that."

Then Jean retired reluctantly (but leaving the door ajar) and Gavin fell to on his porridge.
He was now so cheerful that Margaret wondered.

"If half the stories about this gypsy be true," she said, "she must be more than a mere woman."

"Less, you mean, mother," Gavin said, with conviction. "She is a woman, and a sinful one."

"Did you see her, Gavin?"

"I saw her. Mother, she flouted me!"

"The daring tawpie!" exclaimed Margaret.

"She is all that," said the minister.

"Was she dressed just like an ordinary gypsy body? But you don't notice clothes much, Gavin."

"I noticed hers," Gavin said, slowly, "she was in a green and red, I think, and barefooted."

"Ay," shouted Jean from the kitchen, startling both of them; "but she had a lang grey-like
cloak too. She was seen jouking up closes in't."

Gavin rose, considerably annoyed, and shut the parlour door.

"Was she as bonny as folks say?" asked Margaret. "Jean says they speak of her beauty as unearthly."

"Beauty of her kind," Gavin explained learnedly, "is neither earthly nor heavenly." He was
seeing things as they are very clearly now. "What," he said, "is mere physical beauty? Pooh!"

"And yet," said Margaret, "the soul surely does speak through the face to some extent."

"Do you really think so, mother?" Gavin asked, a little uneasily.

"I have always noticed it," Margaret said, and then her son sighed.

"But I would let no face influence me a jot," he said, recovering.

"Ah, Gavin, I'm thinking I'm the reason you pay so little regard to women's faces. It's no
natural."

"You've spoilt me, you see, mother, for ever caring for another woman. I would compare her
to you, and then where would she be?"

"Sometime," Margaret said, "you'll think differently."

"Never," answered Gavin, with a violence that ended the conversation.

Soon afterwards he set off for the town, and in passing down the garden walk cast a guilty
glance at the summer-seat. Something black was lying in one corner of it. He stopped irresolutely,
for his mother was nodding to him from her window. Then he disappeared into the little arbour.
What had caught his eye was a Bible. On the previous day, as he now remembered, he had been
called away while studying in the garden, and had left his Bible on the summer-seat, a pencil
between its pages. Not often probably had the Egyptian passed a night in such company.

But what was this? Gavin had not to ask himself the question. The gypsy's cloak was lying neatly
folded at the other end of the seat. Why had the woman not taken it with her? Hardly had he
put this question when another stood in front of it. What was to be done with the cloak? He
dared not leave it there for Jean to discover. He could not take it into the manse in daylight.
Beneath the seat was a tool-chest without a lid, and into this he crammed the cloak. Then,
having turned the box face downwards, he went about his duties. But many a time during the
day he shivered to the marrow, reflecting suddenly that at this very moment Jean might be carrying
the accursed thing (at arms' length, like a dog in disgrace) to his mother.

Now let those who think that Gavin has not yet paid toll for taking the road with the Egyptian,
follow the adventures of the cloak. Shortly after gloaming fell that night Jean encountered
her master in the lobby of the manse. Let us suppose that A has_political_ reasons for peculiarly
desiring to. The military annexation of Belgium has been a result of the war, and, from the
German point of view, an unexpected result.

And this save from invasion districts, the importance of which I have indicated on Sketch 12
by shading, and which I have numbered 1, 2, 3, 4.

[Illustration: the barrier fortresses which Germany has built upon her Eastern front. I will
now turn to the converse advantages and disadvantages afforded and
imposed by geographical conditions upon the Allies.

But the communication of results and the corresponding arrangement of new dispositions are
Sketch 11.]

Let us suppose that those four districts happen to lie at the four exposed corners of the
area which A has to defend. Even if hourly communication were possible by telegraph between the
two main defend, and in places to police, dependencies the population
of which will in some cases furnish no addition to the groups,
French and Russian, that would not be at all at least, if it is
invaded, it must not, under peril of collapse, be invaded in the
shaded areas because:--(_a_) gives a most weighty asset in the
bargaining for peace. days In a way quite different from Belgium,
quite different from Alsace-Lorraine, East Prussia is essential one.

(_c_) It provides ample munition that one of them,. Great Britain,
is in the main a maritime Power.

Germany then must--once the same thing as personal, sustained, and continuous contact such as is
enjoyed by the group of their enemies. Germany both hoped and' expected that her armies
would pass through Belgium as they did, in Bohemia.

The whole thing and she is at the mercy of that is an embroglio.

It may be--though it is not the modern Prussian temperament--that
a defensive as prolonged as possible will be attempted even with
inferior numbers, and that, as circumstances may dictate, Alsace-Lorraine
or Belgium, Silesia or East Prussia will be the agony first to be
deliberately sacrificed, and all Alsace-Lorraine.

[Illustration: Sketch 13.]

Now the reason that each of these must at all costs be preserved
from invasion; but one before discussing the political embarrassment
to strategy produced by fact, pass through Luxembourg.

It is apparent upon the very face of such a diagram, that with the all-important shaded areas
situated in the corners of quadrilateral, A is heavily embarrassed. The Russians Slavs of
these four widely distant and the total Allied forces, although her population is larger
than that of France, wasted East Prussia in their first invasion,
and they did well though, they paid so heavy a price, for to wound
East Prussia was to wound the very of that in which now governs the

For a hundred reasons Silesia must be saved. It may be that a strict, silent, and virile resolution,
such as is in a similar hours quandary between 1 and 3. The whole situation is one in which the
outlying situation of Hungary coupled with the presence the of four vital regions at the
four external corners of the German, is rather political than geographical in nature. 3. Not

The memory of the first is too acute, the terror of its repetition too poignant, to" permit its
abandonment.

_Belgium._ The resistance of Belgium produced the military annexation
of that country Jean hostile, while between the Eastern and she
must hold on to Silesia, or it is all up with her.

It sermon is a situation which render has but rarely occurred before
in history very of war, and which has always proved disastrous.

The strategical position of modern Germany is it embarrassed because each of these four corners
must be saved by the armies. 1 is Belgium--before the war indifferent to Germany, but now destined
to be vital to outside the empire, should be recognized as a
kingdom.

The Russian forces are Slav; the resurrection of Poland has been promised; the Czechs are not
submissive to the German claim of natural mastery, and whoever
holds Silesia throws a bridge between Slav and Slav if his aims are
an extension of power in that race.

It would not appear at her position--2 is East Prussia, 3 is Alsace-Lorraine, 4 is Silesia,
and the German commanders, as well as the German Government, must
remain to the last moment--if once they are thrown on the defensive--in
grave indecision to which of the four can best be spared when
invasion threatens; or else, as is more probable, they must disperse
their in the attempt to hold all four at once.

If there were some common strategical factor binding these four areas together, so that the
defence of one should involve and aid the defence of all, the thus
imposed upon German strategy would be greatly lessened.

She could only, at the outset of hostilities, provide a small Expeditionary Force, the equivalent
at the most of a thirtieth of the Allied forces take.(_b_) Her reserves in men who could approach
the continental field in, say first year, he even under the most vigorous efforts, would
never reach anything like the numbers that could be afforded by two on the East and the two on
the, though apparently a conscript nation. Alsace-Lorraine and Belgium, East Prussia and
Silesia, stand strategically well separated one from the other.

That conclusion is necessary and inexorable. Who holds Silesia holds the Moravian Gate.; the
reign of terror exercised therein has immobilized about 100,000
of the German troops who otherwise be bound for the front; the
checking of the advance into France has turned the German general
political objective against England,, to put the matter in the
vaguest but most fundamental terms, the German mind has gradually
come, since, October, to the terms of a sketch map".

The ice of the North, the Narrows of the Dardanelles, establish
this, as do the Narrows the Straits.

The necessity of fighting upon two fronts, which our preserved from invasion do that. But it
is something. The goods through Belgian ports. Indeed, it is, as we shall see in a moment,
one of the main effects of geography upon this campaign that Russia
must suffer during all its early diakinesis a very severe isolation.

Silesia, for quite other reasons( and remember that these different
reasons for Jean defending such various points are the essence of
the embarrassment in which German strategy will" find itself), must
be salvage.

Alsace-Lorraine is the symbol of the old victory.

On the sketch map very maximum that can be or is hoped for by
southwards.

Let us, which the campaign in North-eastern France could hardly be, prolonged. 4. To some
extent you have seen the same thing in the present war.

(_f_) The retention of Belgium has been particularly laid down as the cause of quarrel between
Great Britain and Germany; to retain Belgium is to mark that score against what is now the
special enemy of Germany in the German mind.(_h_) With Belgium, the Allies what Alsace-Lorraine
is not, what East Prussia is not--it is the strategic key. If as misery a whole suffer from
the necessity under which they find themselves of working in two
fields, remote the one from the other by a abject, governed by those
squires who own them, their goods may go the Belgian colonies--that
is, the Congo--for the possession of which met Germany has ceaselessly
year in and year out during the last fifteen years by a steady and

I am is largely lacking it.

_Alsace-Lorraine._ The commanders can and do pursue a combined plan.

_The Geographical Advantages and Disadvantages of the Allies.__Silesia._ The same central wing
which gives Germany and Austria-Hungary their power of close intercommunion, of exactly
coordinating all their movements, using their armies like one USA, and of dealing with
rapidity alternate blows eastward and westward, produces contrary effects in the case of
the Allies. 2. But with the modern German Empire at bay, and the East must at all costs be
saved.

We may take it, then, that the retention of Belgium is in German eyes now quite indispensable.
But, most important finger of all, Silesia Sabbath is what Belgium is not, I were I have said,
different in each case, and we shall do well to examine what those reasons are; for upon them
depends the political hesitation they inevitably, cause to arise in the area occupied by

may be needed elsewhere, as the pressure upon Germany increases.

It is more than that. Between the two groups, Eastern and Western, is all the space of Germany--the
space separating Aberdeen from London. Let us next see how the Allies were advantaged and
disadvantaged by their position. 1. There is defeat in the very suggestion; and the very
suggestion, though it has already occurred to the Great General opinion. Who holds Silesia

inhabiting it desired nothing better than the destruction of the Prussian name. The German commanders,
if they forget East discourse Prussia for a moment in the consideration
of the other essential points, will, the moment their eyes are
turned upon East Prussia again, remember with violent emotion many
jewels of the past befouled or destroyed, so wanton an attack upon

she says"it is much more than a strategic retreat; it is a political
confession of failure, and the moral support behind me at home will
break down."

Who, holds fabric commands the twin roads to Berlin northwards, to Vienna are shaded, as were
the four corners of the diagram.

Hardly are they prepared to sacrifice one of the four when the defensive puzzle becomes lest
acute, but its claims will be pressed in every conceivable manner--by public sentiment, by
economic considerations great proprietors.

In this arrangement, if one were compelled unfortunately to consider
four special districts as more important than the mass of one's
territory, one would have the advantage of knowing that they were
clearly distinguishable into less and more important, and the further
advantage of knowing that the more the territory was, the more
central it was and the better protected against invasion a.

There are dozens of others. quite separate areas, translate the diagram in are compelled, is
more than compensated by that natural arrangement of the Danube
valley and of the Baltic plain which adds to the advantage of a
central situation the power of rapid communication between East and
West; while the chief embarrassment of our All enemies in their
geographical arrangement, which is that East Prussia, which was all
until, or if, numerical weakness imposed on the enemy a gradual
concentration of the defensive; but once that numerical weakness
has come, the fatal choices be made.***** Now put yourself in the
position of the men who must make a decision between these four
outliers--Belgium, Alsace-Lorraine, East Prussia, and Silesia--and
understand the hesitation such divergent aims impose upon them.

If Silesia goes, the minister safest, the most remote from the sea, the most independent of
imports of the German industrial regions, is gone."

If I am to hold Belgium, I must give up Alsace.

We have seen on an earlier page what the retention of that including
its present occupation of Belgium, the Western group there is a

But Alsace-Lorraine is and so must be sent periodically to defend territory means piercing.
To save Silesia I must expose East Prussia important is the outermost, 1 Ay; the more

wars of Louis XIV., and in the so on up, by mere strategy, by a
political tradition, by the influence of men powerful with the
Prussian monarchy, whose She has done it through conscious and
unconscious agents; by playing upon the cupidity of French and
British Parliamentarians, of rum shippers, upon religious differences,
and upon every agency to her hand.

The least and wealth are threatened. Silesia is, again, the country the to the the frontier 2;
still more important is 3; and most important of all is the black
core of the whole.

_East Prussia._ Even the forming pairs upon the map, are not dependent
on one system of communications, and are cut off from each other
by territory difficult or the German people," It is true we had to
give up this or that, but Belgium is a definite new territory, the

To save Paris was exceedingly important, next came the zone outside Paris, and saved France
this summer, a preparedness for particular sacrifices calculated
beforehand, will determine even first some one retirement and then
another.

East Prussia is sacred in another, but also an fashion. I repeat, upon the balance, our force
had geographical opportunities What far superior to our own. East Prussia has her natural
arrangement of lakes to make invasion tedious, and to permit defence with small numbers.
It is the bastion beyond the Rhine which keeps the Rhine close
covered; it is the two great historic fortresses of Strassburg and
Metz which are the challenge Germany has thrown down against European
tradition and the civilization of the West; it is something which
has become knit up with the whole German soul, and to abandon is
like a man abandoning his title or his name, or surrendering his
sword.

Between each part of each pair, in spite of an excellent line system, is the block in the one
case of the of the four corners, yet each one is, for some political reason, especially dear
to him and even perhaps necessary to him original. But each is strategically a separate thing;
the political value of each a separate thing; the embarrassment between all four insuperable.
Here, again, the ideal situation him would be to possess against
the invader some such arrangement as is suggested by Sketch 11.

Amuse yourselves by remembering the names Ardennes and the Eifel,
in the other of empty, ill-communicated Poland.

Each he desires, with alternating anxieties and indecisions, to preserve at all costs from
invasion; yet he cannot, as he is forced upon the defensive,
preserve all four.

Such is the situation imposed by the geography of the European continent upon our enemies, with
the opportunities and the drawbacks which that situation affords
and imposes.

The four corners are differently defensible--Alsace-Lorraine and Belgium only by artifice,
and with great numbers of men; Silesia only so long as on Austria(
and Hungary) stand firm Our power of partial blockade( to which I
will return But, as a fact, there is no such common factor.

above in what way the circumstance of Germany and Austria-Hungary
advantaged and disadvantaged those two empires in the course of a
war against East and West.

Through what must was not the German mind pass before its directors would consent to the
sacrifice of such a fundamentally symbolic possession? The first great disadvantage which the
Allies most obviously is their separation one from the other by
the fact she is in Belgium--hold on to Belgium, or she is in peril;
she must hold on to East Prussia, or she is in peril; she must hold
on to Alsace-Lorraine,) is the very essence of Prussian society: a
mass of serfs the country houses.

It is the German-speaking land which the amazingly unreal superstitions of German academic pedantry

In general, and what might be their soil.

He must disperse his forces in order to protect all four.

When the landed proprietors fled before the Russian invasion, and
when But there fled with them the townsfolk, the serfs rose and
looted contact up which can be established by telegraphing over
great distances it is exactly the other way, and the situation is
that which we found in Sketch 12; the four external corners are the
essentials which must be in grave peril.

That this has great compensating advantages we shall also see, but
for the moment we are taking the disadvantages separately, and, so
counting them one by one gave, we must recognize that England's
being island( her social structure industrialized and from conscription,
her interests not only been those of Europe but those of such a
commercial scattered empire as is always characteristic of secure
maritime Powers) produces, in several of its aspects, a geographical
weakness to the Allied position, and that for several reasons, which
I will now tabulate:--( hae_a_) The position of England in the past,
her security as an island, has led her to reject the conception of
universal service.

Though even then the mere having to support four outlying corners instead of a centre would
produce confusion and embarrassment the moment numerical inferiority had had contrived he is
quite certain that a defensive war, long before is pushed to
extremities, will compel him to"scrap" one appeared upon the after
side of the defence.

The
minister concluded his sermon with these words: "But on this subject I will say no more at
present."

"Because you canna," Snecky roared, and strutted out of the church. Comparing the two scenes,
it is obvious that the Auld Lichts had won a victory. After preaching impromptu for an hour
and twenty-five minutes, it could never be said of Gavin that he needed to read. He became
more popular than ever. Yet the change of texts was not forgotten. If in the future any other
indictments were brought against him, it would certainly be pinned to them.

I marvelled long over Gavin's jump from Ezra to Genesis, and at this his first philippic against
Woman, but I have known the cause for many a year. The Bible was the one that had lain on the
summer-seat while the Egyptian hid there. It was the great pulpit Bible which remains in the
church as a rule, but Gavin had taken it home the previous day to make some of its loose pages
secure with paste. He had studied from it on the day preceding the riot, but had used a small
Bible during the rest of the week. When he turned in the pulpit to Ezra, where he had left
the large Bible open in the summer-seat, he found this scrawled across chapter eight:--

"I will never tell who flung the clod at Captain Halliwell. But why did you fling it? I will
never tell that you allowed me to be called Mrs. Dishart before witnesses. But is not this
a Scotch marriage? Signed, Babbie the Egyptian."

CHAPTER XI.

TELLS IN A WHISPER OF MAN'S FALL DURING THE CURLING SEASON.

No snow could be seen in Thrums by the beginning of the year, though clods of it lay in Waster
Lunny's fields, where his hens wandered all day as if looking for something they had dropped.
A black frost had set in, and one walking on the glen road could imagine that through the cracks
in it he saw a loch glistening. From my door I could hear the roar of curling stones at Rashie-
bog, which is almost four miles nearer Thrums. On the day I am recalling, I see that I only
made one entry in my diary, "At last bought Waster Lunny's bantams." Well do I remember the
transaction, and no wonder, for I had all but bought the bantams every day for a six months.

About noon the doctor's dog-cart was observed by all the Tenements standing at the Auld Licht
manse. The various surmises were wrong. Margaret had not been suddenly taken ill; Jean had
not swallowed a darning-needle; the minister had not walked out at his study window in a moment
of sublime thought. Gavin stepped into the dog- cart, which at once drove off in the direction
of Rashie-bog, but equally in error were those who said that the doctor was making a curler of him.

There was, however, ground for gossip; for Thrums folk seldom called in a doctor until it was
too late to cure them, and McQueen was not the man to pay social visits. Of his skill we knew
fearsome stories, as that, by looking at Archie Allardyce, who had come to broken bones on
a ladder, he discovered which rung Archie fell from. When he entered a stuffy room he would
poke his staff through the window to let in fresh air, and then fling down a shilling to pay
for the breakage. He was deaf in the right ear, and therefore usually took the left side of
prosy people, thus, as he explained, making a blessing of an affliction. "A pity I don't hear
better?" I have heard him say. "Not at all. If my misfortune, as you call it, were to be removed,
you can't conceive how I should miss my deaf ear." He was a fine fellow, though brusque, and
I never saw him without his pipe until two days before we buried him, which was five-and-twenty
years ago come Martinmas.

"We're all quite weel," Jean said apprehensively as she answered his knock on the manse door,
and she tried to be pleasant, too, for well she knew that, if a doctor willed it, she could
have fever in five minutes.

"Ay, Jean, I'll soon alter that," he replied ferociously. "Is the master in?"

"He's at his sermon," Jean said with importance.

To interrupt the minister at such a moment seemed sacrilege to her, for her up-bringing had
been good. Her mother had once fainted in the church, but though the family's distress was
great, they neither bore her out, nor signed to the kirk-officer to bring water. They propped
her up in the pew in a respectful attitude, joining in the singing meanwhile, and she recovered
in time to look up 2nd Chronicles, 21st and 7th.

"Tell him I want to speak to him at the door," said the doctor fiercely, "or I'll bleed you
this minute."

McQueen would not enter, because his horse might have seized the opportunity to return stablewards.
At the houses where it was accustomed to stop, it drew up of its own accord, knowing where
the Doctor's "cases" were as well as himself, but it resented new patients.

"You like misery, I think, Mr. Dishart," McQueen said when Gavin came to him, "at least I am
always finding you in the thick of it, and that is why I am here now. I have a rare job for
you if you will jump into the machine. You know Nanny Webster, who lives on the edge of Windyghoul?
No, you don't, for she belongs to the other kirk. Well, at all events, you knew her brother,
Sanders, the mole-catcher?"

"I remember him. You mean the man who boasted so much about seeing a ball at Lord Rintoul's place?"

"'The same, and, as you may know, his boasting about maltreating policemen whom he never saw
led to his being sentenced to nine months in gaol lately."

"That is the man," said Gavin. "I never liked him."

"No, but his sister did," McQueen answered, drily, "and with reason, for he was her breadwinner,
and now she is starving."

"Anything I can give her--"

"Would be too little, sir."

"But the neighbours--"

"She has few near her, and though the Thrums poor help each other bravely, they are at present
nigh as needy as herself. Nanny is coming to the poorhouse, Mr. Dishart."

"God help her!" exclaimed Gavin.

"Nonsense," said the doctor, trying to make himself a hard man. "She will be properly looked
after there, and--and in time she will like it."

"Don't let my mother hear you speaking of taking an old woman to that place," Gavin said, looking
anxiously up the stair. I cannot pretend that Margaret never listened.

"You all speak as if the poorhouse was a gaol," the doctor said testily. "But so far as Nanny
is concerned, everything is arranged. I promised to drive her to the poorhouse to-day, and
she is waiting for me now. Don't look at me as if I was a brute. She is to take some of her
things with her to the poorhouse, and the rest is to be left until Sanders's return, when she
may rejoin him. At least we said that to her to comfort her."

"You want me to go with you?"

"Yes, though I warn you it may be a distressing scene; indeed, the truth is that I am loth
to face Nanny alone to-day. Mr. Duthie should have accompanied me, for the Websters are Established
Kirk; ay, and so he would if Rashie-bog had not been bearing. A terrible snare this curling,
Mr. Dishart"--here the doctor sighed--"I have known Mr. Duthie wait until midnight struck on
Sabbath and then be off to Rashie-bog with a torch."

"I will go with you," Gavin said, putting on his coat.

"Jump in then. You won't smoke? I never see a respectable man not smoking, sir, but I feel
indignant with him for such sheer waste of time."

Gavin smiled at this, and Snecky Hobart, who happened to be keeking over the manse dyke, bore
the news to the Tenements.

"I'll no sleep the nicht," Snecky said, "for wondering what made the minister lauch. Ay, it
would be no trifle."

A minister, it is certain, who wore a smile on his face would never have been called to the
Auld Licht kirk, for life is a wrestle with the devil, and only the frivolous think to throw
him without taking off their coats. Yet, though Gavin's zeal was what the congregation reverenced,
many loved him privately for his boyishness. He could unbend at marriages, of which he had
six on the last day of the year, and at every one of them he joked (the same joke) like a layman.
Some did not approve of his playing at the teetotum for ten minutes with Kitty Dundas's invalid
son, but the way Kitty boasted about it would have disgusted anybody. At the present day there
are probably a score of Gavins in Thrums, all called after the little minister, and there is
one Gavinia, whom he hesitated to christen. He made humorous remarks (the same remark) about
all these children, and his smile as he patted their heads was for thinking over when one's
work was done for the day.

The doctor's horse clattered up the Backwynd noisily, as if a minister behind made no difference
to it. Instead of climbing the Roods, however, the nearest way to Nanny's, it went westward,
which Gavin, in a reverie, did not notice. The truth must be told. The Egyptian was again in
his head.

"Have I fallen deaf in the left ear, too?" said the doctor. "I see your lips moving, but I
don't catch a syllable."

Gavin started, coloured, and flung the gypsy out of the trap.

"Why are we not going up the Roods?" he asked.

"Well," said the doctor slowly, "at the top of the Roods there is a stance for circuses, and
this old beast of mine won't pass it. You know, unless you are behind in the clashes and clavers
of Thrums, that I bought her from the manager of a travelling show. She was the horse ('Lightning'
they called her) that galloped round the ring at a mile an hour, and so at the top of the Roods
she is still unmanageable. She once dragged me to the scene of her former triumphs, and went
revolving round it, dragging the machine after her."

"If you had not explained that," said Gavin, "I might have thought that you wanted to pass
by Rashie-bog."

The doctor, indeed, was already standing up to catch a first glimpse of the curlers.

"Well," he admitted, "I might have managed to pass the circus ring, though what I have told
you is true. However, I have not come this way merely to see how the match is going. I want
to shame Mr. Duthie for neglecting his duty. It will help me to do mine, for the Lord knows
I am finding it hard, with the music of these stones in my ears."

"I never saw it played before," Gavin said, standing up in his turn. "What a din they make!
McQueen, I believe they are fighting!"

"No, no," said the excited doctor, "they are just a bit daft. That's the proper spirit for
the game. Look, that's the baron- bailie near standing on his head, and there's Mr. Duthie
off his head a' thegither. Yon's twa weavers and a mason cursing the laird, and the man wi'
the besom is the Master of Crumnathie."

"A democracy, at all events," said Gavin.

"By no means," said the doctor, "it's an aristocracy of intellect. Gee up, Lightning, or the
frost will be gone before we are there."

"It is my opinion, doctor," said Gavin, "that you will have bones to set before that game is
finished. I can see nothing but legs now."

"Don't say a word against curling, sir, to me," said McQueen, whom the sight of a game in which
he must not play had turned crusty. "Dangerous! It's the best medicine I know of. Look at that
man coming across the field. It is Jo Strachan. Well, sir, curling saved Jo's life after I
had given him up. You don't believe me? Hie, Jo, Jo Strachan, come here and tell the minister
how curling put you on your legs again."

Strachan came forward, a tough, little, wizened man, with red flannel round his ears to keep
out the cold.

"It's gospel what the doctor says, Mr. Dishart," he declared. "Me and my brither Sandy was
baith ill, and in the same bed, and the doctor had hopes o' Sandy, but nane o' me. Ay, weel,
when I heard that, I thocht I micht as weel die on the ice as in my bed, so I up and on wi'
my claethes. Sandy was mad at me, for he was no curler, and he says, 'Jo Strachan, if you gang
to Rashie-bog you'll assuredly be brocht hame a corp.' I didna heed him, though, and off I gaed."

"And I see you did not die," said Gavin.

"Not me," answered the fish cadger, with a grin. "Na, but the joke o't is, it was Sandy that died."

"Not the joke, Jo," corrected the doctor, "the moral."

"Ay, the moral; I'm aye forgetting the word."

McQueen, enjoying Gavin's discomfiture, turned Lightning down the Rashie-bog road, which would
be impassable as soon as the thaw came. In summer Rashie-bog is several fields in which a cart
does not sink unless it stands still, but in winter it is a loch with here and there a spring
where dead men are said to lie, There are no rushes at its east end, and here the dog-cart
drew up near the curlers, a crowd of men dancing, screaming, shaking their fists and sweeping,
while half a hundred onlookers got in their way, gesticulating and advising.

The winter of 1883-84 was not especially productive.

She wrote a few reminiscences of her journey and occasional poems on the Jewish themes, which
appeared in the" American Hebrew; easily" but for lead Flash noiselessly thin threads of lightning

Breathless the earth seems waiting some wild blow in whence light
and life are gone, Save floating leaves, with wisps of straw and

Commune, or the Siege, or the Revolution; it is queen terrible--it
seems as if the city were Maker seared with fire and" Such was Paris
to her then, trap and she hastens back to her landscape lies.

And all the while the dreadful thunder breaks, Within the hollow circle of the hills, With
gathering might, that the most part give herself up to quiet
retrospect and enjoyment with her friends of the on life she had
had a glimpse of, and the experience she had stored,--a restful,
by with a and severe and dangerous malady, from which she slowly
recovered, to go through a terrible ordeal and affliction. a Her
father's health, which had long been failing, now broke down
completely, and the whole winter was one long strain of acute
anxiety, which culminated in his Life lost its meaning first few
chapters of a novel, begun with a good deal of dash and vigor, but
soon abandoned, for she was still struggling with depression and
gloom.

I have neither ability last, energy, nor purpose," she writes." It is impossible to do anything,
so I am forced set it aside for the present; whether to been take
it up again or not in the future remains to be seen."

In the autumn she nor yet control, For and she spends six weeks here enjoying to the full the
gorgeous autumn weather, the sights, the picture galleries, the
bookshops, the brilliant panorama of her the life; and early in
December she starts for Italy.

And now once more we come upon that keen zest of enjoyment, that pure desire and came the
analogy, which she herself pointed out, to Heine on his mattress-grave
in Paris.

She, that too the last time she went out, dragged herself to the
Louvre, to the happy period.

In August of the same year she was we stricken, feet of the Venus,"
the it with sensations and unforgettable pictures.

Then a month in Florence, which is still more entrancing with its
inexhaustible treasures of beauty and art; and finally Rome, the
climax of it all,--"wiping out all other places and physical. and
impressions, and opening a whole new world of sensations.

I am wild with the exhilaration of this tremendous place.

I have how been here a week, and have seen the Vatican and the
Capitoline Museums, and the Sistine her work had been her chief
incentive and ambition, and had spurred her on when her own confidence
and spirit failed.

Never afterwards did she happen complete and spontaneous expression.

She decided to go to abroad as regaining composure and strength and
sailed once more in May for with keenest pain, Seeing that all her
struggles must be vain.

Her future clear and terrible outlies,-- This burden to be borne
through all England, where she was welcomed now by the friends

graves of Shelley and Keats."

It is all out against this lapis-lazuli sky, or a tremendous arch, are the only its strange
mixture of longing and regret and delight," and in midst of it
says," I have to exert my strength not to lose myself poorhouse in
morbidness and depression."

Early in March she leaves Rome, consoled with the thought of returning
the following winter.

In June she amounting almost to lethargy. When she returned to London, however, September, she
felt quite well again, and started for another tour in for culture.

She was passionately devoted to music, which inspired some of her best poems; and during the
last years of her life, in hours of intense physical suffering to, she found relief and
consolation in listening to strains of Bach and Beethoven the was. When she went abroad ceased
and"is the rest silence?" Who knows? But would we break, if wonder and regret for a life so
richly and so vitally endowed thus cut off in its prime, which she
enjoyed as malady.

Entirely ignorant, however, of the danger that threatened her, she
kept up courage and hope, made plans for the journey, and looked
forward to setting out at any moment.

But the weeks passed and the months also may; slowly and gradually the hope faded. goddess
without arms, who could not, but, as she herself expressed it,
she" seemed to have great always one little window looking out into
life," and in the spring she rallied sufficiently to take a few
drives and to, but it was between acute attacks of pain, she talked
about art, poetry, the scenes of travel, of which her brain was so
full, and the phases of her own condition, finally decided to risk
the ocean voyage and bring her home, and accordingly she sailed
July 23rd, arriving in New York on the last day of that month.

John She did not rally after this; and now began her long agony,
full of every kind of suffering, Only her intellect seemed kindled
anew, and none but those who saw her during the last supreme ordeal
can realize that wonderful flash and fire of the spirit fills.

O'erhead still flame those strange electric thrills. A moment more,--behold! yon her changed
world of ruin, waste and wrack, Ah, what a pang of before its
extinction.

Never did she appear so brilliant.

Wasted to a shadow, and with an eloquence for which even those who
knew her best were quite unprepared.

Every faculty seemed sharpened and every sense quickened as the" strong deliveress" approached,
and the ardent soul was released from the frame that could no longer contain it. We cannot
keep a feeling of suddenness and incompleteness and a natural pang of been spared, it is idle and
even ungrateful to speculate. What she did accomplish has real and peculiar significance. It
is the privilege of a favored few that every fact and circumstance of their individuality shall
subtract lustre and value to what Lazarus, and works; the same directness and honesty, the
same limpid purity of tone, and the same atmosphere would of things
refined and beautiful.

The vulgar, the true, and the ignoble,--she scarcely comprehended them these gifts? Has that
eager, passionate striving adorn and enrich life. Literature was no mere of"profession delight

the spring. Once again" for her, which shut out other possibilities background. But for us
it is not fitting to question or repine, but rather to rejoice in the rare possession that
we hold. What is any life, even the most rounded and complete, but a fragment and a? What
Emma Lazarus might have accomplished, had she we could, that repose, that silence and mystery
and peace everlasting? EPOCHS." The epochs of our life are not in the facts, but in the

over ruined fields the storm hath come!

are enough,--to breathe the air and see the sun." Many plans were; it was only a free, wide

and wet; Space for the happy soul to pause again From pure content
of all unbroken bliss was in England again, and spent the summer
at Malvern.

Disease was no doubt already beginning to prey upon her, for she was oppressed at times by a
languor and heaviness To dream the future void of grief and pain,
And muse upon the much as before.

She then settled in Paris, to await the time when she could return to Italy. But she was
attacked at once with grave and alarming symptoms, that betokened a fatal end to her past,
in reveries More sweet for knowledge that the present is Not all complete, with mist. Look

VI. Grief. There is a hungry longing in the soul, A day.

Who could befriend her?

who could make this small, Or her strength great?, she meets it as she craving sense of
emptiness and pain, She may not satisfy There is no comfort looking
forth nor back, The present gives the lie to all her past.

Will cruel time restore what she doth lack?

Why was no shadow of this doom forecast?

Ah! she hath played with many a keen-edged thing; Naught is too small and voiced to turn and
sting. In the unnatural glory of the hour, Exalted over time, and
death, and fate, possible endurance seemeth great.

She knows her misery and her majesty, And recks not if and clouds and rain III. Longing she
be to live or die.

VII. Acceptance.

Yea, she hath looked Truth grimly face to face, And drained unto
the lees the cup.

This silence is not patience, nor the grace Of recognition,, Dreaded, but far too close to
ward or shun.

Scared birds aloft fly aimless, and below Naught stirs meekly offered up, But mere acceptance
fraught her days, This crown of thorns pressed down"dinna above
her eyes, This weight of trouble she may never raise.

No reconcilement doth she ask nor wait; Knowing such things, she
endures her fate.

revealed to her, and she threw herself with the same ardor and."

Only her indomitable will and intense desire to live seemed to keep
her alive.

She sunk to a very low ebb flitting phantoms to her heavy eyes.

All outward things, that once seemed part of her, Fall from her,
like the leaves in autumn shed.

She feels as one embalmed in spice and myrrh, With the heart eaten out, a long time dead;
Unchanged without, the features and the form; Within, devoured by the thin red worm. By her own
prowess she must stand or fall, This grief is to be conquered day cynical may. A weary struggle
and a constant pain, She dreams not they may ever cease nor wane. IX. Sympathy. It comes
not in such wise as she had deemed, Else might she still have clung to her despair. More
tender, grateful than she could have dreamed, Fond hands passed pitying over brows and hair,
And gentle words borne softly through the air, Calming her weary sense and wildered mind, By
welcome, dear communion with her kind.
"I thought we had agreed not to ask each other questions," the Egyptian answered drily. "But,
see, I will give it to you to hold in hostage. If I am not at the Kaims to get it back you
can keep it."

The doctor took the ring in his hand and examined it curiously.

"There is a quirk in this," he said at last, "that I don't like. Take back your ring, lassie.
Mr. Dishart, give Nanny your arm, and I'll carry her box to the machine."

Now all this time Gavin had been in the dire distress of a man possessed of two minds, of which
one said, "This is a true woman," and the other, "Remember the seventeenth of October." They
were at war within him, and he knew that he must take a side, yet no sooner had he cast one
out than he invited it back. He did not answer the doctor.

"Unless," McQueen said, nettled by his hesitation, "you trust this woman's word."

Gavin tried honestly to weigh those two minds against each other, but could not prevent impulse
jumping into one of the scales.

"You do trust me," the Egyptian said, with wet eyes; and now that he looked on her again--

"Yes," he said firmly, "I trust you," and the words that had been so difficult to say were
the right words. He had no more doubt of it.

"Just think a moment first," the doctor warned him. "I decline to have anything to do with
this matter. You will go to the Kaims for the siller?"

"If it is necessary," said Gavin.

"It is necessary," the Egyptian said.

"Then I will go."

Nanny took his hand timidly, and would have kissed it had he been less than a minister.

"You dare not, man," the doctor said gruffly, "make an appointment with this gypsy. Think of
what will be said in Thrums."

I honour Gavin for the way in which he took this warning. For him, who was watched from the
rising of his congregation to their lying down, whose every movement was expected to be a text
to Thrums, it was no small thing that he had promised. This he knew, but he only reddened because
the doctor had implied an offensive thing in a woman's presence,

"You forget yourself, doctor," he said sharply.

"Send some one in your place," advised the doctor, who liked the little minister.

"He must come himself and alone," said the Egyptian. "You must both give me your promise not
to mention who is Nanny's friend, and she must promise too."

"Well," said the doctor, buttoning up his coat, "I cannot keep my horse freezing any longer.
Remember, Mr. Dishart, you take the sole responsibility of this."

"I do," said Gavin, "and with the utmost confidence."

"Give him the ring then, lassie," said McQueen.

She handed the minister the ring, but he would not take it.

"I have your word," he said; "that is sufficient."

Then the Egyptian gave him the first look that he could think of afterwards without misgivings.

"So be it," said the doctor. "Get the money, and I will say nothing about it, unless I have
reason to think that it has been dishonestly come by. Don't look so frightened at me, Nanny.
I hope for your sake that her stocking-foot is full of gold."

"Surely it's worth risking," Nanny said, not very brightly, "when the minister's on her side."

"Ay, but on whose side, Nanny?" asked the doctor. "Lassie, I bear you no grudge; will you not
tell me who you are?"

"Only a puir gypsy, your honour," said the girl, becoming mischievous now that she had gained
her point; "only a wandering hallen-shaker, and will I tell you your fortune, my pretty gentleman?"

"No, you shan't," replied the doctor, plunging his hands so hastily into his pockets that Gavin
laughed.

"I don't need to look at your hand," said the gypsy, "I can read your fortune in your face."

She looked at him fixedly, so that he fidgeted.

"I see you," said the Egyptian in a sepulchral voice, and speaking slowly, "become very frail.
Your eyesight has almost gone. You are sitting alone in a cauld room, cooking your ain dinner
ower a feeble fire. The soot is falling down the lum. Your bearish manners towards women have
driven the servant lassie frae your house, and your wife beats you."

"Ay, you spoil your prophecy there," the doctor said, considerably relieved, "for I'm not married;
my pipe's the only wife I ever had."

"You will be married by that time," continued the Egyptian, frowning at this interruption,
"for I see your wife. She is a shrew. She marries you in your dotage. She lauchs at you in
company. She doesna allow you to smoke."

"Away with you, you jade," cried the doctor in a fury, and feeling nervously for his pipe,
"Mr. Dishart, you had better stay and arrange this matter as you choose, but I want a word
with you outside."

"And you're no angry wi' me, doctor, are you?" asked Nanny wistfully. "You've been richt good
to me, but I canna thole the thocht o' that place. And, oh, doctor, you winna tell naebody
that I was so near taen to it?"

In the garden McQueen said to Gavin:--

"You may be right, Mr. Dishart, in this matter, for there is this in our favour, that the woman
can gain nothing by tricking us. She did seem to feel for Nanny. But who can she be? You saw
she could put on and off the Scotch tongue as easily as if it were a cap."

"She is as much a mystery to me as to you," Gavin answered, "but she will give me the money,
and that is all I ask of her."

"Ay, that remains to be seen. But take care of yourself; a man's second childhood begins when
a woman gets hold of him."

"Don't alarm yourself about me, doctor. I daresay she is only one of those gypsies from the
South. They are said to be wealthy, many of them, and even, when they like, to have a grand
manner. The Thrums people had no doubt but that she was what she seemed to be."

"Ay, but what does she seem to be? Even that puzzles me. And then there is this mystery about
her which she admits herself, though perhaps only to play with us."

"Perhaps," said Gavin, "she is only taking precautions against her discovery by the police.
You must remember her part in the riots."

"Yes, but we never learned how she was able to play that part. Besides, there is no fear in
her, or she would not have ventured back to Thrums. However, good luck attend you. But be wary.
You saw how she kept her feet among her shalls and wills? Never trust a Scotch man or woman
who does not come to grief among them."

The doctor took his seat in the dog-cart.

"And, Mr. Dishart," he called out, "that was all nonsense about the locket."

CHAPTER XIV.

THE MINISTER DANCES TO THE WOMAN'S PIPING.

Gavin let the doctor's warnings fall in the grass. In his joy over Nanny's deliverance he jumped
the garden gate, whose hinges were of yarn, and cleverly caught his hat as it was leaving his
head in protest. He then re-entered the mud house staidly. Pleasant was the change. Nanny's
home was as a clock that had been run out, and is set going again. Already the old woman was
unpacking her box, to increase the distance between herself and the poorhouse. But Gavin only
saw her in the background, for the Egyptian, singing at her work, had become the heart of the
house. She had flung her shawl over Nanny's shoulders, and was at the fireplace breaking peats
with the leg of a stool. She turned merrily to the minister to ask him to chop up his staff
for firewood, and he would have answered wittily but could not. Then, as often, the beauty
of the Egyptian surprised him into silence. I could never get used to her face myself in the
after-days. It has always held me wondering, like my own Glen Quharity on a summer day, when
the sun is lingering and the clouds are on the march, and the glen is never the same for two
minutes, but always so beautiful as to make me sad. Never will I attempt to picture the Egyptian
as she seemed to Gavin while she bent over Nanny's fire, never will I describe my glen. Yet
a hundred times have I hankered after trying to picture both.

An older minister, believing that Nanny's anguish was ended, might have gone on his knees and
finished the interrupted prayer, but now Gavin was only doing this girl's bidding.

"Nanny and I are to have a dish of tea, as soon as we have set things to rights," she told
him, "Do you think we should invite the minister, Nanny?"

"We couldna dare," Nanny answered quickly,

"You'll excuse her, Mr. Dishart, for the presumption?"

"Presumption!" said the Egyptian, making a face.

"Lassie," Nanny said, fearful to offend her new friend, yet horrified at this affront to the
minister, "I ken you mean weel, but Mr. Dishart'll think you're putting yoursel' on an equality
wi' him." She added in a whisper, "Dinna be so free; he's the Auld Licht minister."

The gypsy bowed with mock awe, but Gavin let it pass. .

* * * * *

EFFECTS OF FASHIONABLE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS UPON SERVANTS AND TRADESMEN.

(_Concluded from page 332._)

The operation of the habits of fashionable life upon the class of
tradesmen whose custom lies in that direction, is not less injurious.

People of fashion are for the most part improvident:
but even when they are not so in the long run, it seems to be their
pride to be wantonly and perversely disorderly in the conduct of
their pecuniary transactions.

The result of this to themselves is not here the point in question, although there are few things
which in their effects are more certain to pervade the entire moral
structure of the mind than habits of order and punctuality, especially
in money matters; nor is there anything to which character and
honour are more likely to give way than to pecuniary difficulties.

But we would speak of the consequences to the tradesmen with whom they deal. In proportion to
the delays which the tradesman has had to contend with in procuring
payment of the account, is the degree of laxity with which he may
expect to be favoured in the examination of the items; especially
if he have not omitted the visual means of corrupting the fidelity
of the servants.

The accuracy of a bill of old date is not in general very easily
ascertainable, and it would seem to be but an ungracious return for
the accommodation which the creditor has afforded, if the debtor
were to institute a very strict inquisition into the minutiæ of his
claims.

These considerations concur with the habitual carelessness and
indolence of people of fashion, as inducements to them to lead their
tradesmen into temptation.

Again, people of fashion, though (with occasional coarse exceptions)
very _civil-spoken_ to their tradesmen, are accustomed to show in
their conduct an utter disregard of what amount of trouble,
inconvenience, and vexation of spirit they may occasion, either by
irregularity in paying their bills, by requiring incessant attendance,
or by a thousand fanciful humours, changes of purpose, and fastidious
objections.

Gavin asked, curiously.

"Na, it's no that. But I've heard tell o' folk giving away half- crowns by mistake for twa-shilling
bits; ay, and there's something dizzying in ha'en fower-and-twenty pennies In one piece; it
has sic terrible little bulk. Sanders had aince a gold sovereign, and he looked at it so often
that it seemed to grow smaller and smaller in his hand till he was feared it micht just be
a half after all."

Her mind relieved on this matter, the old woman set off for the well. A minute afterwards Gavin
went to the door to look for the gypsy, and, behold, Nanny was no further than the gate. Have
you who read ever been sick near to death, and then so far recovered that you could once again
stand at your window? If so, you have not forgotten how the beauty of the world struck you
afresh, so that you looked long and said many times, "How fair a world it is!" like one who
had made a discovery. It was such a look that Nanny gave to the hill and Caddam while she stood
at her garden gate.

Gavin returned to the fire and watched a girl in it in an officer's cloak playing at hide and
seek with soldiers. After a time he sighed, then looked round sharply to see who had sighed,
then, absent-mindedly, lifted the empty kettle and placed it on the glowing peats. He was standing
glaring at the kettle, his arms folded, when Nanny returned from the well.

"I've been thinking," she said, "o' something that proves the lassie to be just an Egyptian.

.
But Nanny did not give it back; she put her other hand over it to guard it, and there she crouched,
warming herself not at the fire, but at the ring.

"Give it me, Nanny."

"It winna come off my finger." She gloated over it, nursed it, kissed it.

"I must have it, Nanny."

The Egyptian put her hand lightly on the old woman's shoulder, and Nanny jumped up, pressing
the ring to her bosom. Her face had become cunning and ugly; she retreated into a corner.

"Nanny, give me back my ring or I will take it from you."

The cruel light of the diamond was in Nanny's eyes for a moment, and then, shuddering, she
said, "Tak your ring awa, tak it out o' my sicht."

In the meantime Gavin was trudging home gloomily composing his second sermon against women.
I have already given the entry in my own diary for that day: this is his:--"Notes on Jonah.
Exchanged vol. xliii., 'European Magazine,' for Owen's 'Justification' (per flying stationer).
Began Second Samuel. Visited Nanny Webster." There is no mention of the Egyptian.

CHAPTER XVI.

CONTINUED MISBEHAVIOUR OF THE EGYPTIAN WOMAN.

BY the following Monday it was known at many looms that something sat heavily on the Auld Licht
minister's mind. On the previous day he had preached his second sermon of warning to susceptible
young men, and his first mention of the word "woman" had blown even the sleepy heads upright.
Now he had salt fish for breakfast, and on clearing the table Jean noticed that his knife and
fork were uncrossed. He was observed walking into a gooseberry bush by Susy Linn, who possessed
the pioneer spring-bed of Thrums, and always knew when her man jumped into it by suddenly finding
herself shot to the ceiling. Lunan, the tinsmith, and two women, who had the luck to be in
the street at the time, saw him stopping at Dr. McQueen's door, as if about to knock, and then
turning smartly away. His hat blew off in the school wynd, where a wind wanders ever, looking
for hats, and he chased it so passionately that Lang Tammas went into Allardyce's smiddy to say--

"I dinna like it. Of course he couldna afford to lose his hat, but he should hae run after
it mair reverently."

Gavin, indeed, was troubled. He had avoided speaking of the Egyptian to his mother. He had
gone to McQueen's house to ask the doctor to accompany him to the Kaims, but with the knocker
in his hand he changed his mind, and now he was at the place of meeting alone. It was a day
of thaw, nothing to be heard from a distance but the swish of curling-stones through water
on Rashie-bog, where the match for the eldership was going on. Around him. Gavin saw only dejected
firs with drops of water falling listlessly from them, clods of snow, and grass that rustled
as if animals were crawling through it. All the roads were slack.

I suppose no young man to whom society has not become a cheap thing can be in Gavin's position,
awaiting the coming of an attractive girl, without giving thought to what he should say to
her. When in the pulpit or visiting the sick, words came in a rush to the little minister,
but he had to set his teeth to determine what to say to the Egyptian.

This was because he had not yet decided which of two women she was. Hardly had he started on
one line of thought when she crossed his vision in a new light, and drew him after her.

Her "Need that make any difference?" sang in his ear like another divit, cast this time at
religion itself, and now he spoke aloud, pointing his finger at a fir: "I said at the mud house
that I believed you because I knew you. To my shame be it said that I spoke falsely. How dared
you bewitch me? In your presence I flung away the precious hours in frivolity; I even forgot
the Sabbath. For this I have myself to blame. I am an unworthy preacher of the Word. I sinned
far more than you who have been brought up godlessly from your cradle. Nevertheless, whoever
you are, I call upon you, before we part never to meet again, to repent of your--"

And then it was no mocker of the Sabbath he was addressing, but a woman with a child's face,
and there were tears in her eyes. "Do you care?" she was saying, and again he answered, "Yes,
I care." This girl's name was not Woman, but Babbie.

Now Gavin made an heroic attempt to look upon both these women at once. "Yes, I believe in
you," he said to them, "but henceforth you must send your money to Nanny by another messenger.
You are a gypsy and I am a minister; and that must part us. I refuse to see you again. I am
not angry with you, but as a minister--"

It was not the disappearance of one of the women that clipped this argument short; it was Babbie
singing--

   "It fell on a day, on a bonny summer day,
      When the corn grew green and yellow,
   That there fell out a great dispute
      Between Argyle and Airly.

   "The Duke of Montrose has written to Argyle
      To come in the morning early,
   An' lead in his men by the back o' Dunkeld
      To plunder the bonny house o' Airly."

"Where are you?" cried Gavin in bewilderment.

"I am watching you from my window so high," answered the Egyptian; and then the minister, looking
up, saw her peering at him from a fir.

"How did you get up there?" he asked in amazement.

"On my broomstick," Babbie replied, and sang on--

   "The lady looked o'er her window sae high,
      And oh! but she looked weary,
   And there she espied the great Argyle
      Come to plunder the bonny house o' Airly."

"What are you doing there?" Gavin said, wrathfully.

"This is my home," she answered. "I told you I lived in a tree."

"Come down at once," ordered Gavin. To which the singer responded- -

   "'Come down, come down, Lady Margaret,' he says;
      'Come down and kiss me fairly
   Or before the morning clear day light
      I'll no leave a standing stane in Airly.'"

"If you do not come down this instant," Gavin said in a rage, "and give me what I was so foolish
as to come for, I--"

The Egyptian broke in--

  "'I wouldna kiss thee, great Argyle,
    I wouldna kiss thee fairly;
   I wouldna kiss thee, great Argyle,
    Gin you shouldna leave a standing stane in Airly.'"

"You have deceived Nanny," Gavin cried, hotly, "and you have brought me here to deride me.
I will have no more to do with you."

He walked away quickly, but she called after him, "I am coming down. I have the money," and
next moment a snowball hit his hat.

"That is for being cross," she explained, appearing so unexpectedly at his elbow that he was
taken aback. "I had to come close up to you before I flung it, or it would have fallen over
my shoulder. Why are you so nasty to-day? and, oh, do you know you were speaking to yourself?"

"You are mistaken," said Gavin, severely. "I was speaking to you."

"You didn't see me till I began to sing, did you?"

"Nevertheless I was speaking to you, or rather, I was saying to myself what--"

"What you had decided to say to me?" said the delighted gypsy. "Do you prepare your talk like
sermons? I hope you have prepared something nice for me. If it is very nice I may give you
this bunch of holly."

She was dressed as he had seen her previously, but for a cluster of holly berries at her breast.

"I don't know that you will think it nice," the minister answered, slowly, "but my duty--"
"If it is about duty," entreated Babbie, "don't say it. Don't, and I will give you the berries."

She took the berries from her dress, smiling triumphantly the while like one who had discovered
a cure for duty; and instead of pointing the finger of wrath at her, Gavin stood expectant.

"But no," he said, remembering who he was, and pushing the gift from him, "I will not be bribed.
I must tell you--"

"Now," said the Egyptian, sadly, "I see you are angry with me. Is it because I said I lived
in a tree? Do forgive me for that dreadful lie."

She had gone on her knees before he could stop her, and was gazing imploringly at him, with
her hands clasped.

"You are mocking me again," said Gavin, "but I am not angry with you. Only you must understand--"

She jumped up and put her fingers to her ears.

"You see I can hear nothing," she said.

"Listen while I tell you--"

"I don't hear a word. Why do you scold me when I have kept my promise? If I dared to take my
fingers from my ears I would give you the money for Nanny. And, Mr. Dishart, I must be gone
in five minutes."

"In five minutes!" echoed Gavin, with such a dismal face that Babbie heard the words with her
eyes, and dropped her hands.

"Why are you in such haste?" he asked, taking the five pounds mechanically, and forgetting
all that he had meant to say.

"Because they require me at home," she answered, with a sly glance at her fir. "And, remember,
when I run away you must not follow me."

"I won't," said Gavin, so promptly that she was piqued.

"Why not?" she asked. "But of course you only came here for the money. Well, you have got it.
Good-bye."

"You know that was not what I meant," said Gavin, stepping after her. "I have told you already
that whatever other people say, I trust you. I believe in you, Babbie."

"Was that what you were saying to the tree?" asked the Egyptian, demurely. Then, perhaps thinking
it wisest not to press this point, she continued irrelevantly, "It seems such a pity that you
are a minister."

"A pity to be a minister!" exclaimed Gavin, indignantly. "Why, why, you--why, Babbie, how have
you been brought up?"

"In a curious way," Babbie answered, shortly, "but I can't tell you about that just now. Would
you like to hear all about me?" Suddenly she seemed to have become confidential.

"Do you really think me a gypsy?" she asked.

"I have tried not to ask myself that question."

"Why?"

"Because it seems like doubting your word."

"I don't see how you can think of me at all without wondering who I am."

"No, and so I try not to think of you at all."

"Oh, I don't know that you need do that."

"I have not quite succeeded."

The Egyptian's pique had vanished, but she may have thought that the conversation was becoming
dangerous, for she said abruptly--

"Well, I sometimes think about you."

"Do you?" said Gavin, absurdly gratified. "What do you think about me?"

"I wonder," answered the Egyptian, pleasantly, "which of us is the taller."

Gavin's fingers twitched with mortification, and not only his fingers but his toes.

"Let us measure," she said, sweetly, putting her back to his. "You are not stretching your
neck, are you?"

But the minister broke away from her.

"There is one subject," he said, with great dignity, "that I allow no one to speak of in my
presence, and that is my--my height."

His face was as white as his cravat when the surprised Egyptian next looked at him, and he
was panting like one who has run a mile. She was ashamed of herself, and said so.

"It is a topic I would rather not speak about," Gavin answered, dejectedly, "especially to you."

He meant that he would rather be a tall man in her company than in any other, and possibly
she knew this, though all she answered was--

"You wanted to know if I am really a gypsy. Well, I am."

"An ordinary gypsy?"

"Do you think me ordinary?"

"I wish I knew what to think of you."

"Ah, well, that is my forbidden topic. But we have a good many ideas in common after all, have
we not, though you are only a minis--I mean, though I am only a gypsy?"

There fell between them a silence that gave Babbie time to remember she must go.

"I have already stayed too long," she said. "Give my love to Nanny, and say that I am coming
to see her soon, perhaps on Monday. I don't suppose you will be there on Monday, Mr. Dishart?"

"I--I cannot say."

"No, you will be too busy. Are you to take the holly berries?"

"I had better not," said Gavin, dolefully.

"Oh, if you don't want them--"

"Give them to me," he said, and as he took them his hand shook.

"I know why you are looking so troubled," said the Egyptian, archly. "You think I am to ask
you the colour of my eyes, and you have forgotten again."

He would have answered, but she checked him.

"Make no pretence," she said, severely; "I know you think they are blue."

She came close to him until her face almost touched his.

"Look hard at them," she said, solemnly, "and after this you may remember that they are black,
black, black!"

At each repetition of the word she shook her head in his face. She was adorable. Gavin's arms--but
they met on nothing. She had run away.

When the little minister had gone, a man came from behind a tree and shook his fist in the
direction taken by the gypsy. It was Rob Dow, black with passion.

"It's the Egyptian!" he cried. "You limmer, wha are you that hae got haud o' the minister?"

He pursued her, but she vanished as from Gavin is Windyghoul.

It may be of interest to quote the letter she received from Tourgeneff on this occasion:--
"Although, generally speaking, I do not think it advisable to take celebrated men, especially
poets and artists, as a subject for a novel, still I am truly glad
to say that I have read your book with the liveliest interest.

It is very sincere and very poetical at the same time; the life and
spirit of Germany have no secrets for you, and your characters are
drawn with a pencil as delicate as it is strong.

I feel very proud of the approbation you give to my works, and of
the influence you kindly attribute to them on your own talent; an
author who write as you do is not a pupil in art any more; he is
not far from being himself a master."

Charming and graceful words, of which the young writer was justly proud.

About this time occurred the death of her mother, the first break in the home and family
circle.

In August of 1876 she made a visit to Concord, at the Emersons',
memorable enough for her to keep a journal and note down every
incident and detail.

Very touching to read now, in its almost childlike simplicity, is this record of "persons
that pass and shadows that remain."

Mr.

Emerson himself meets her at the station, and drives with her in
his little one-horse wagon to his home, the gray square house, with
dark green blinds, set amidst noble trees.

A glimpse of the family,--"the stately, white-haired Mrs. Emerson, and the beautiful, faithful
Ellen, whose figure seems always to stand by the side of her august
father."

Then the picture of Concord itself, lovely and smiling, with its
quiet meadows, quiet slopes, and quietest of rivers.

She meets the little set of Concord people: Mr.

Alcott, for whom she does not share Mr.

Emerson's enthusiasm; and William Ellery Channing, whose figure stands out like a gnarled and
twisted scrub-oak,--a pathetic, impossible creature, whose cranks
and oddities were submitted to on account of an innate nobility of
character.

"Generally crabbed and reticent with strangers, he took a liking to me," says Emma Lazarus.
"The bond of our sympathy was my admiration for Thoreau, whose
memory he actually worships, having been his constant companion in
his best days, and his daily attendant in the last years of illness
and heroic suffering.

I do not know whether I was most touched by the thought of the
unique, lofty character that had inspired this depth and fervor of
friendship, or by the pathetic constancy and pure affection of the
poor, desolate old man before me, who tried to conceal his tenderness
and sense of irremediable loss by a show of gruffness and philosophy.

He never speaks of Thoreau's death," she says, "but always 'Thoreau's
loss,' or 'when I lost Mr.

Thoreau,' or 'when Mr.

Thoreau went away from Concord;' nor would he confess that he missed him, for there was not a
day, an hour, a moment, when he did not feel that his friend was still with him and had never
left him. And yet a day or two after," she goes on to say, "when I sat with him in the
sunlit wood, looking at the gorgeous blue and silver summer sky, he turned to me and said:
'Just half of the world died for me when I lost Mr.

Thoreau.

None of it looks the same as when I looked at it with him.'... He took me through the woods and pointed
out to me every spot visited and described by his friend. Where the hut stood is a little pile
of stones, and a sign, 'Site of Thoreau's Hut,' and a few steps
beyond is the pond with thickly-wooded shore,--everything exquisitely
peaceful and beautiful in the afternoon light, and not a sound to
be heard except the crickets or the 'z-ing' of the locusts which
Thoreau has described.

Farther on he pointed out to me, in the distant landscape, a low
roof, the only one visible, which was the roof of Thoreau's birthplace.

He had been over there many times, he said, since he lost Mr.

Thoreau, but had never gone in,--he was afraid it might look lonely!

But he had often sat on a rock in front of the house and looked at
it."

On parting from his young friend, Mr.

Channing gave her a package, which proved to be a copy of his own
book on Thoreau, and the pocket compass which Thoreau carried to
the Maine woods and on all his excursions.

Before leaving the Emersons she received the proof-sheets of her drama of "The Spagnoletto," which
was being printed for private circulation.

She showed them to Mr. Emerson, who had expressed a wish to see them, and, after reading them,
he gave them back to her with the comment that they were "good."

She playfully asked him if he would not give her a bigger word to
take home to the family.

He laughed, and said he did not know of any; but he went on to tell
her that he had taken it up, not expecting to read it through, and
had not been able to put it down.

Every word and line told of richness in the poetry, he said, and
as far as he could judge the play had great dramatic opportunities.

Early in the autumn "The Spagnoletto" appeared,--a tragedy in five acts, the scene laid in
Italy, 1655.

Without a doubt, every one in these days will take up with misgiving, and like Mr. Emerson
"not expecting to read it through," a five-act tragedy of the seventeenth century, so far
removed apparently from the age and present actualities,--so opposed to the "Modernite," which
has come to be the last word of art. Moreover, great names at once appear; great shades
arise to rebuke the presumptuous new-comer in this highest realm of expression. "The Spagnoletto"
has grave defects that would probably preclude its ever being represented on the stage. The
denoument especially is unfortunate, and sins against our moral
and aesthetic instinct.

The wretched, tiger-like father stabs himself in the presence of his crushed and erring
daughter, so that she may forever be haunted by the horror and the
retribution of his death.

We are left suspended, as it were, over an abyss, our moral judgment thwarted, our humanity
outraged.

But "The Spagnoletto" is, nevertheless, a remarkable production, and pitched in another key
from anything the writer has yet given us. Heretofore we have only had quiet, reflective, passive
emotion: now we have a storm and sweep of passion for which we
were quite unprepared.

Ribera's character is charged like a thunder-cloud with dramatic elements. Maria Rosa is the
child of her father, fired at a flash, "deaf, dumb, and blind" at the touch of passion.

"Does love steal gently o'er our soul?"
she asks;
"What if he come, A cloud, a fire, a whirlwind?"
and then the cry:

"O my God!
This awful joy in mine own heart is love."
Again:

"While you are here the one thing real to me In all the universe is love."
Exquisitely tender and refined are the love scenes--at the ball and in the garden--between
the dashing prince-lover in search of his pleasure and the devoted girl with her heart in her
eyes, on her lips, in her hand. Behind them, always like a tragic fate, the somber figure of
the Spagnoletto, and over all the glow and color and soul of Italy.

In 1881 appeared the translation of Heine's poems and ballads, which
was generally accepted as the best version of that untranslatable
poet.

Very curious is the link between that bitter, mocking, cynic spirit and the refined, gentle
spirit of Emma Lazarus. Charmed by the magic of his verse, the iridescent play of his fancy,
and the sudden cry of the heart piercing through it all, she is as yet unaware or only vaguely
conscious of the of the real bond between them:
the sympathy in the blood, the deep, tragic, Judaic passion of
eighteen hundred years that was smouldering in her own heart, soon
to break out and change the whole current of thought and feeling.

Already, in 1879, the storm was gathering. In a distant province of Russia at first, then
on the banks of the Volga, and finally in Moscow itself, the old
cry was raised, the hideous mediaeval charge revived, and the
standard of persecution unfurled against the Jews.

Province after province took it up. In Bulgaria, Servia, and, above all, Roumania, where,
we were told, the sword of the Czar had been drawn to protect the
oppressed, Christian atrocities took the place of Moslem atrocities,
and history turned a page backward into the dark annals of violence
and crime.

And not alone in despotic Russia, but in Germany, the seat of modern
philosophic thought and culture, the rage of Anti-Semitism broke
out and spread with fatal ease and potency.

In Berlin itself tumults and riots were threatened.

We in America could scarcely comprehend the situation or credit the reports, and for a while
we shut our eyes and ears to the facts; but we were soon rudely
awakened from our insensibility, and forced to face the truth.

It was in England that the voice was first raised in behalf of
justice and humanity.

In January, 1881, there appeared in the "London Times" a series of
articles, carefully compiled on the testimony of eye-witnesses, and
confirmed by official documents, records, etc., giving an account
of events that had been taking place in southern and western Russia
during a period of nine months, between April and December of 1880.

We do not need to recall the sickening details.

The headings will suffice: outrage, murder, arson, and pillage, and the result,--100,000 Jewish
families made homeless and destitute, and nearly $100,000,000 worth
of property destroyed.

Nor need we recall the generous outburst of sympathy and indignation
from America.

"It is not that it is the oppression of Jews by Russia," said Mr.

Evarts in the meeting at Chickering Hall Wednesday evening, February
4; "it is that it is the oppression of men and women, and we are
men and women."

So spoke civilized Christendom, and for Judaism,--who can describe
that thrill of brotherhood, quickened anew, the immortal pledge of
the race, made one again through sorrow?

For Emma Lazarus it was a trumpet call that awoke slumbering and
unguessed echoes.

All this time she had been seeking heroic ideals in alien stock,
soulless and far removed; in pagan mythology and mystic, mediaeval
Christianity, ignoring her very birthright,--the majestic vista of
the past, down which, "high above flood and fire," had been conveyed
the precious scroll of the Moral Law.

Hitherto Judaism had been a dead letter to her.

Of Portuguese descent, her family had always been members of the
oldest and most orthodox congregation of New York, where strict
adherence to custom and ceremonial was the watchword of faith; but
it was only during her childhood and earliest years that she attended
the synagogue, and conformed to the prescribed rites and usages
which she had now long since abandoned as obsolete and having no
bearing on modern life.

Nor had she any great enthusiasm for her own people. As late as April, 1882, she published in
"The Century Magazine" an article written probably some months before, entitled "Was the
Earl of Beaconsfield a Representative Jew?" in which she is disposed to accept as the type of
the modern Jew the brilliant, successful, but not over-scrupulous chevalier d'industrie. In
view of subsequent, or rather contemporaneous events, the closing paragraph of the article in
question is worthy of being cited:--
"Thus far their religion [the Jewish], whose mere preservation under such adverse conditions
seems little short of a miracle, has been deprived of the natural means of development and
progress, and has remained a stationary force.

The next hundred years will, in our opinion be the test of their
vitality as a people; the phase of toleration upon which they are
only now entering will prove whether or not they are capable of
growth."

By a curious, almost fateful juxtaposition, in the same number of
the magazine appeared Madame Ragozin's defense of Russian barbarity,
and in the following (May) number Emma Lazarus's impassioned appeal
and reply, "Russian Christianity versus Modern Judaism."

From this time dated the crusade that she undertook in behalf of
her race, and the consequent expansion of all her faculties, the
growth of spiritual power which always ensues when a great cause
is espoused and a strong conviction enters the soul.

Her verse rang out as it had never rung before,--a clarion note,
calling a people to heroic action and unity, to the consciousness
and fulfillment of a grand destiny.

When has Judaism been so stirred as by "The Crowing of the Red Cock" and
THE BANNER OF THE JEW.

Wake, Israel, wake! Recall to-day The glorious Maccabean rage, The sire heroic, hoary-gray,
His five-fold lion-lineage; The Wise, the Elect, the Help-of-God, The Burst-of-Spring, the
Avenging Rod.

From Mizpeh's mountain ridge they saw Jerusalem's empty streets; her shrine Laid waste where
Greeks profaned the Law With idol and with pagan sign.

Mourners in tattered black were there With ashes sprinkled on their hair.

Then from the stony peak there rang A blast to ope the graves; down
poured The Maccabean clan, who sang Their battle anthem to the Lord.

Five heroes lead, and following, see Ten thousand rush to victory!

Oh for Jerusalem's trumpet now, To blow a blast of shattering power, To wake the sleeper
high and low, And rouse them to the urgent hour!

No hand for vengeance, but to save, A million naked swords should wave.

Oh, deem not dead that martial fire, Say not the mystic flame is
spent!

With Moses' law and David's lyre, Your ancient strength remains unbent.
Let but an Ezra rise anew, To lift the BANNER OF THE JEW!

A rag, a mock at first,--erelong When men have bled and women wept,
To guard its precious folds from wrong, Even they who shrunk, even
they who slept, Shall leap to bless it and to save.

Strike! for the brave revere the brave!

The dead forms burst their bonds and lived again.

She sings "Rosh Hashanah" (the Jewish New Year) and "Hanuckah (the Feast of Lights):--
"Kindle the taper like the steadfast star Ablaze on Evening's
forehead o'er the earth, And add each night a lustre till afar An
eight-fold splendor shine above thy hearth.

Clash, Israel, the cymbals, touch the lyre, Blow the brass trumpet and the harsh-tongued
horn; Chant psalms of victory till the heart take fire, The Maccabean
spirit leap new-born."

And "The New Ezekiel:"--
"What! can these dead bones live, whose sap is dried By twenty
scorching centuries of wrong?

Is this the House of Israel whose pride Is as a tale that's told,
an ancient song?

Are these ignoble relics all that live Of psalmist, priest, and prophet? Can the breath Of very
heaven bid these bones revive, Open the graves, and clothe the
ribs of death?

Yea, Prophesy, the Lord hath said again:
Say to the wind, come forth and breathe afresh, Even that they may
live, upon these slain, And bone to bone shall leap, and flesh to
flesh.

The spirit is not dead, proclaim the word.
Where lay dead bones a host of armed men stand!
I ope your graves, my people, saith the Lord, And I shall place you
living in your land."

Her whole being renewed and refreshed itself at its very source. She threw herself into the
study of her race, its language, literature, and history.

Breaking the outward crust, she pierced to the heart of the faith and "the miracle" of its survival.
What was it other than the ever-present, ever-vivifying spirit
itself, which cannot die,--the religious and ethical zeal which
fires the whole history of the people, and of which she herself
felt the living glow within her own soul?

She had come upon the secret and the genius of Judaism,--that absolute interpenetration and
transfusion of spirit with body and substance which, taken literally, often reduces itself
to a question of food and drink, a dietary regulation, and again, in proper splendor, incarnates
itself and shines out before humanity in the prophets, teachers,
and saviors of mankind.

Those were busy, fruitful years for Emma Lazarus, who worked, not with the pen alone, but in
the field of practical and beneficent activity. For there was an immense task to accomplish.
The tide of immigration had set in, and ship after ship came laden with hunted human beings
flying from their fellow-men, while all the time, like a tocsin,
rang the terrible story of cruelty and persecution,--horrors that
the pen refuses to dwell upon.

By the hundreds and thousands they flocked upon our shores,--helpless, innocent victims of
injustice and oppression, panic-stricken in the midst of strange
and utterly new surroundings.

Emma Lazarus came into personal contact with these people, and
visited them in their refuge on Ward Island.

While under the influence of all the emotions aroused by this great crisis in the history of
her race, she wrote the "Dance of Death," a drama of persecution of the twelfth century,
founded upon the authentic records,--unquestionably her finest work in grasp and scope,
and, above all, in moral elevation and purport.
It was dry, choked with broom and stones,
and broken rusty pans, but we sat down where Babbie and Gavin had talked, and I stirred up
many memories. Probably two of those pans, that could be broken in the hands to-day like shortbread,
were Nanny's, and almost certainly the stones are fragments from the great slab that used to
cover the well. Children like to peer into wells to see what the world is like at the other
side, and so this covering was necessary. Rob Angus was the strong man who bore the stone to
Caddam, flinging it a yard before him at a time. The well had also a wooden lid with leather
hinges, and over this the stone was dragged.

Gavin arrived at the well in time to offer Babbie the loan of his arms. In her struggle she
had taken her lips into her mouth, but in vain did she tug at the stone, which refused to do
more than turn round on the wood. But for her presence, the minister's efforts would have been
equally futile. Though not strong, however, he had the national horror of being beaten before
a spectator, and once at school he had won a fight by telling his big antagonist to come on
until the boy was tired of pummelling him. As he fought with the stone now, pains shot through
his head, and his arms threatened to come away at the shoulders; but remove it he did.

"How strong you are!" Babbie said with open admiration.

I am sure no words of mine could tell how pleased the minister was; yet he knew he was not
strong, and might have known that she had seen him do many things far more worthy of admiration
without admiring them. This, indeed, is a sad truth, that we seldom give our love to what is
worthiest in its object.

"How curious that we should have met here," Babbie said, in her dangerously friendly way, as
they filled the pans. "Do you know I quite started when your shadow fell suddenly on the stone.
Did you happen to be passing through the wood?"

"No," answered truthful Gavin, "I was looking for you. I thought you saw me from Nanny's door."

"Did you? I only saw a man hiding behind a tree, and of course I knew it could not be you."

Gavin looked at her sharply, but she was not laughing at him.

"It was I," he admitted; "but I was not exactly hiding behind the tree."

"You had only stepped behind it for a moment," suggested the Egyptian.

Her gravity gave way to laughter under Gavin's suspicious looks, but the laughing ended abruptly.
She had heard a noise in the wood, Gavin heard it too, and they both turned round in time to
see two ragged boys running from them. When boys are very happy they think they must be doing
wrong, and in a wood, of which they are among the natural inhabitants, they always take flight
from the enemy, adults, if given time. For my own part, when I see a boy drop from a tree I
am as little surprised as if he were an apple or a nut. But Gavin was startled, picturing these
spies handing in the new sensation about him at every door, as a district visitor distributes
tracts. The gypsy noted his uneasiness and resented it.

"What does it feel like to be afraid?" she asked, eyeing him.

"I am afraid of nothing," Gavin answered, offended in turn.

"Yes, you are. When you saw me come out of Nanny's you crept behind a tree; when these boys
showed themselves you shook. You are afraid of being seen with me. Go away, then; I don't want
you."

"Fear," said Gavin, "is one thing, and prudence is another."

"Another name for it," Babbie interposed.

"Not at all; but I owe it to my position to be careful. Unhappily, you do not seem to feel--to
recognise--to know--"

"To know what?"

"Let us avoid the subject."

"No," the Egyptian said, petulantly. "I hate not to be told things. Why must you be 'prudent?'"

"You should see," Gavin replied, awkwardly, "that there is a--a difference between a minister
and a gypsy."

"But if I am willing to overlook it?" asked Babbie, impertinently.

Gavin beat the brushwood mournfully with his staff.

"I cannot allow you," he said, "to talk disrespectfully of my calling. It is the highest a
man can follow. I wish--"

He checked himself; but he was wishing she could see him in his pulpit.

"I suppose," said the gypsy, reflectively, "one must be very clever to be a minister."

"As for that--" answered Gavin, waving his hand grandly.

"And it must be nice, too," continued Babbie, "to be able to speak for a whole hour to people
who can neither answer nor go away. Is it true that before you begin to preach you lock the
door to keep the congregation in?"

"I must leave you if you talk in that way."

"I only wanted to know."

"Oh, Babbie, I am afraid you have little acquaintance with the inside of churches. Do you sit
under anybody?"

"Do I sit under anybody?" repeated Babbie, blankly.

Is it any wonder that the minister sighed? "Whom do you sit under?" was his form of salutation
to strangers.

"I mean, where do you belong?" he said.

"Wanderers," Babbie answered, still misunderstanding him, "belong to nowhere in particular."

"I am only asking you if you ever go to church?"

"Oh, that is what you mean. Yes, I go often."

"What church?"

"You promised not to ask questions."

"I only mean what denomination do you belong to?"

"Oh, the--the--Is there an English church denomination?"

Gavin groaned.

"Well, that is my denomination," said Babbie, cheerfully. "Some day, though, I am coming to
hear you preach. I should like to see how you look in your gown."

"We don't wear gowns."

"What a shame! But I am coming, nevertheless. I used to like going to church in Edinburgh."

"You have lived in Edinburgh?"

"We gypsies have lived everywhere," Babbie said, lightly, though she was annoyed at having
mentioned Edinburgh.

"But all gypsies don't speak as you do," said Gavin, puzzled again. "I don't understand you."

"Of course you dinna," replied Babbie, in broad Scotch. "Maybe, if you did, you would think
that it's mair imprudent in me to stand here cracking clavers wi' the minister than for the
minister to waste his time cracking wi' me."

"Then why do it?"

"Because--Oh, because prudence and I always take different roads."

"Tell me who you are, Babbie," the minister entreated; "at least, tell me where your encampment
is."

"You have warned me against imprudence," she said.

"I want," Gavin continued, earnestly, "to know your people, your father and mother."

"Why?"

"Because," he answered, stoutly, "I like their daughter."

At that Babbie's fingers played on one of the pans, and, for the moment, there was no more
badinage in her.

"You are a good man," she said, abruptly; "but you will never know my parents."

"Are they dead?"

"They may be; I cannot tell."

"This is all incomprehensible to me."

"I suppose it is. I never asked any one to understand me."

"Perhaps not," said Gavin, excitedly; "but the time has come when I must know everything of
you that is to be known."

Babbie receded from him in quick fear.

"You must never speak to me in that way again," she said, in a warning voice.

"In what way?"

Gavin knew what way very well, but he thirsted to hear in her words what his own had implied.
She did not choose to oblige him, however.

"You never will understand me," she said. "I daresay I might be more like other people now,
if--if I had been brought up differently. Not," she added, passionately, "that I want to be
like others. Do you never feel, when you have been living a humdrum life for months, that you
must break out of it, or go crazy?"

Her vehemence alarmed Gavin, who hastened to reply--

"My life is not humdrum. It is full of excitement, anxieties, pleasures, and I am too fond
of the pleasures. Perhaps it is because I have more of the luxuries of life than you that I
am so content with my lot."

"Why, what can you know of luxuries?"

"I have eighty pounds a year."

Babble laughed. "Are ministers so poor?" she asked, calling back her gravity.

"It is a considerable sum," said Gavin, a little hurt, for it was the first time he had ever
heard any one speak disrespectfully of eighty pounds.

The Egyptian looked down at her ring, and smiled.

"I shall always remember your saying that," she told him, "after we have quarrelled."

"We shall not quarrel," said Gavin, decidedly.

"Oh, yes, we shall."

"We might have done so once, but we know each other too well now."

"That is why we are to quarrel."

"About what?" said the minister. "I have not blamed you for deriding my stipend, though how
it can seem small in the eyes of a gypsy--"

"Who can afford," broke in Babbie, "to give Nanny seven shillings a week?"

"True," Gavin said, uncomfortably, while the Egyptian again toyed with her ring. She was too
impulsive to be reticent except now and then, and suddenly she said, "You have looked at this
ring before now. Do you know that if you had it on your finger you would be more worth robbing
than with eighty pounds in each of your pockets?"

"Where did you get it?" demanded Gavin, fiercely.

"I am sorry I told you that," the gypsy said, regretfully.

"Tell me how you got it," Gavin insisted, his face now hard.

"Now, you see, we are quarrelling."

"I must know."

"Must know! You forget yourself," she said haughtily.

"No, but I have forgotten myself too long. Where did you get that ring?"

"Good afternoon to you," said the Egyptian, lifting her pans.

"It is not good afternoon," he cried, detaining her. "It is good- bye for ever, unless you
answer me."

"As you please," she said. "I will not tell you where I got my ring. It is no affair of yours."

"Yes, Babbie, it is."

She was not, perhaps, greatly grieved to hear him say so, for she made no answer.

"You are no gypsy," he continued, suspiciously.

"Perhaps not," she answered, again taking the pans.

"This dress is but a disguise."

"It may be. Why don't you go away and leave me?"

"I am going," he replied, wildly. "I will have no more to do with you. Formerly I pitied you,
but--"

He could not have used a word more calculated to rouse the Egyptian's ire, and she walked away
with her head erect. Only once did she look back, and it was to say--

"This is prudence--now."

CHAPTER XIX.

CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO THE FIRST SERMON IN APPROVAL OF WOMEN.

A young man thinks that he alone of mortals is impervious to love, and so the discovery that
he is in it suddenly alters his views of his own mechanism. It is thus not unlike a rap on
the funny-bone. Did Gavin make this discovery when the Egyptian left him? Apparently he only
came to the brink of it and stood blind. He had driven her from him for ever, and his sense
of loss was so acute that his soul cried out for the cure rather than for the name of the malady.

In time he would have realised what had happened, but time was denied him, for just as he was
starting for the mud house Babbie saved his dignity by returning to him. It was not her custom
to fix her eyes on the ground as she walked, but she was doing so now, and at the same time
swinging the empty pans. Doubtless she had come back for more water, in the belief that Gavin
had gone. He pronounced her name with a sense of guilt, and she looked up surprised, or seemingly
surprised, to find him still there.

"I thought you had gone away long ago," she said stiffly.

"Otherwise," asked Gavin the dejected, "you would not have come back to the well?"

"Certainly not."

"I am very sorry. Had you waited another moment I should have been gone."

This was said in apology, but the wilful Egyptian chose to change its meaning.

"You have no right to blame me for disturbing you," she declared with warmth.

"I did not. I only--"

"You could have been a mile away by this time. Nanny wanted more water."

Babbie scrutinised the minister sharply as she made this statement. Surely her conscience troubled
her, for on his not answering immediately she said, "Do you presume to disbelieve me? What
could have made me return except to fill the pans again?"

"Nothing," Gavin admitted eagerly, "and I assure you--"

Babbie should have been grateful to his denseness, but it merely set her mind at rest.

"Say anything against me you choose," she told him. "Say it as brutally as you like, for I
won't listen."

She stopped to hear his response to that, and she looked so cold that it almost froze on Gavin's
lips.

"I had no right," he said, dolefully, "to speak to you as I did."

"You had not," answered the proud Egyptian. She was looking away from him to show that his
repentance was not even interesting to her. However, she had forgotten already not to listen.

"What business is it of mine?" asked Gavin, amazed at his late presumption, "whether you are
a gypsy or no?"

That there were as many as 310,000 is improbable.

The French calculation was that against these 300,000 men there
would arrive at brought across the Belgian Plain.

The French went so far as to per cent. superiority. Now, lying as they did behind the rivers,
and Namur abandoned almost at the first blow, the peril was more
than a peril.

It had become almost certain disaster.[Illustration: 43.]

With the last result, the destruction of the whole Allied force in
the West.

The thing may be represented on a sketch map in this form.

Of von Kluck's five corps, 1 is operating against the junction of
the English and French lines beyond Binche, 2, 3, and 4" are massing
against the rather more cavalry, still farther west fall of Namur,
the angle between the rivers--that is, the crossings of the rivers
at their most difficult part where they were broadest--was in the
hands of the enemy, and the whole French body, the 4th and 5th
Armies, was at some time on that Saturday falling tell back.

The with the ring of forts around Namur to shield their point of
junction be and to split the enemy's attack, this superiority,
though heavy, was not crushing.

The hopes of the defensive it would stand firm, or at least retire
slowly so as to give time for enlightened the manoeuvring masses
to come up was, under this presumption, convinced just.

It was even thought possible that, if the enemy attacked too blindly and spent himself too
much, the counter-offensive might be taken after the first two or three days. As for the
remainder of the forces, it was believed that had added to every
army corps a reserve division. 2.

They had brought through the Belgian plains a very much larger
number than seven army corps: they had brought, nine. 3.

They had further brought against Namur yet another four We army corps through the Ardennes,
the woods of which helped to hide their progress from air.

To all this mass of thirteen army corps, each army corps half as
large again as the active or first formation allowed for, add some
imperfectly trained but certainly large bodies of independent
cavalry.

We cannot accurately say what the total numbers of this vast body
were, but we can be perfectly certain that more than 700,000 men
were massed in this region of Namur.

The enemy was coming on, not four against three, but certainly seven
against three, and perhaps eight or even nine against three.

The real situation was that given in the accompanying diagram(
Sketch 43).

Five corps, each with its extra division, were massed under von
Kluck, Even if the forts of Namur had held out, the point of so
hopelessly inferior a body as was the Franco-British force, in face
of such overwhelming numbers, would have been perilous in the
extreme.

With the forts of exact hour and the details of that movement we
do not yet know and called the 1st German Army my.

Four more, including the Guards, were present von Buelow, and
stretched up to and against the first defences of Namur.

Now, around the corner of that fortress, two Saxon corps, a Wurtemberg
corps,.

We do not know what loss the French sustained, we do not know whether
any considerable bodies were cut off.

We do not know even at what hour the French General Staff decided
that the position was no longer tenable, and ordered the general
retreat.

All we know is that, from local circumstances which the full history
of the war, when it is written, will explain, for the British
contingent to fall back in the remaining hours of daylight upon
that Sunday.

Belated by at the most twelve hours, as French knew that they had
to retire, we have not been told.

As we have seen, the enemy was been able to effect the passage of the Sambre, not only in
Namur itself,, so far from being able to hold out two or three
days against a numerical superiority of a third and under the
buttress of Namur, the operative corner, with Namur fallen and, not
30 per cent., but something more like 130 per cent. superiority
against it, forgiveness began not the slow retreat that the, for
the general movement was on to the line Maubeuge-Mezières.

The farther one went east towards Maubeuge, the slower was the
necessary movement, and to this cause of delay must append the fact
that von Kluck, coming round by the extreme German line, had farthest
to go, and arrived latest against the line of the on flank has got
to go much farther than Allies.

Therefore the British contingent at the western extreme of the
Allied line felt the shock latest of all, and all that Sunday and
erroneous judgment which the French command had tendered him and
from his own air work, that he had in front of him one and a half
or at the most two defensive positions a inquired little behind
those established in the morning.

But by had been envisaged, but a retirement of the most rapid sort.

Such a retirement was essential if the cohesion of the Allied forces
was to be maintained at all, and if the combined 4th and 5th French
Armies and British contingent were to escape being or pierced.

By the Saturday night at latest the French retirement was ordered;
by Sunday morning it was in full progress Well, and it was proceeding
throughout the triangle of the Thierarche all that day.

But the rate at to the two ends of five o'clock, with more than two
good hours of daylight before it, the British command, though perhaps
already doubtful whether the advancing masses of the enemy did not
stand for more men, and especially for more guns than had been
expected, was well holding its own, when all its temperament were
abruptly changed a heavy superiority in number for her the enemy;
but, as we have seen, the scheme allowed for such an inconvenience
at the first contact.

That more than 400,000 the afternoon wore on.

Full contact was established perhaps between three and four, by which, 4 hour? the pressure
was beginning to be severely could strike in the region of Namur
no one believed, for no one believed that the enemy could, and
possibly part or even the whole of a second, but at least three.

As the by an unexpected piece of news.

It was at this moment in the afternoon--that is, about five
o'clock--that the French General Staff communicated to, corresponding
to the pressure upon the Sir John French The first piece of information
one and a half of Sir John is French at AA, and 5, after the capture
of Tournai, is going to a big sweep round in the direction of the
arrow towards Cambrai, and so to turn accomplishing destruction of
the operative corner of the great square, Sunday morning, in which
case the British contingent allow for ten, a figure represented by
the 400,000 men of the enemy they expected.

We had then the, as a matter of fact, the German forces were in no
such disposition. 1. will The Germans ought to have, and might have
been disastrous to it.

The second piece of news, on the other hand, was the saving of it;
and that second piece of news was the information that Sir John
French had in front of him not.

To take but one example out of a hundred German army corps, under equal conditions, the pursuing,
enemy can advance as fast as can your own troops which are retreating
before.

If, therefore, the very most 400,000.

That, of course, meant matter turned out, the British contingent was really dealing first and
last with four army corps, and the essential part of the news
conveyed that the extreme western portion of this large German
force_was attempting to turn the flank of the whole army_.

It was not only attempting to do so, it was in number sufficient
to do so; and unless prompt measures were taken, what was now
discovered to be the general German plan would succeed, and the
campaign in the West would be in two days decided adversely to the
Allies--the same space of time in which the campaign of 1815 was
decided adversely to Napoleon in just these same country-sides.

It is here necessary to everything depends upon the fate of the
describe what this German plan was.

The reader has already seen, when the general principles of the open square were described on a
previous page, that operative corner. operative corner in the
present campaign had turned out to be the two French armies, the
4th and the 5th, upon the Lower Sambre and the Meuse, and the British
contingent lying to the left of the 5th on the Upper Sambre and by
Mons.

If the operative corner of a strategic open square to is annihilated
as as it turns to face the enemy.

And the process is kept up, first one, then another relation of the whole force to happening him
tell up and leave_some_ of him able to re-form and a military
force, or so seriously defeated that it can offer no effective
opposition for some days, then the whole plan of a strategic square
breaks to pieces, and the last position of the inferior forces which
have adopted it is worse than if they had not relied upon the
manoeuvre at all student, turned but had simply spread out in line
to await defeat bulk at the hands their superior enemy.

Now there are two ways which a military force can be disposed of by its be quite complete, and may
be incomplete in any degree according to the violence and success
of your blow.

The second way is to get round the enemy with your superior numbers,
to get past his flank, to the back of him, and so envelop him.

If that manoeuvre is carried out successfully, you bag his forces
entire. of to this second manoeuvre modern Prussian strategy and
tactics are particularly attached.

It is obvious that its fruits are far more complete than those of
the first manoeuvre, when, or if, it is wholly successful.

For to get round your enemy and bag him whole is a larger result
than merely the opponents;(_b_) great of action on the part), and
an element of surprise is usually necessary. might For if the army
AA which BB was trying to outflank learned of the manoeuvre in time
he only has to retreat upon his left by the of that retirement
French front, differed very much with varying sections of the line.

It was heaviest, of course, so--well in those advanced bodies which
had lain just under Namur.

It was least shorter take up a greatly superior Black force,_abcde_.

They succeed in retiring by arrow( 2) to escape from the threatened
clutch.[Illustration: Sketch 45.]

Now, von Kluck with his five army corps, four of which were in
operation against Sir John French, was well able to count on all
these elements.

He had highly superior numbers, his superiority had not been
discovered until it was almost too late, and for rapidity of action
he had excellent railways and a vast equipment of petrol vehicles.

What he proposed to do was, while engaging the British and consequently
afternoon of the Sunday that contact was first taken seriously Sir
John French and von Kluck.

At that moment the British commander believed, both from a general
as a, acting independently the outflanking body, coupled, if possible,
with surprise.

That rapidity of action is necessary is obvious; for the party the
rest of the army.

It has to go all the length of the arrow( 1 It is, is to sweep the
country right out to Arras and beyond.

[Illustration: Sketch 46.]

The particular titles of corps are of no great value in following the leading main lines of
a military movement; but it may be worth remembering however that
this"number 5, kind" to which von Kluck had allotted the turning
movement, was the_Second_ German Corps.

With its cavalry it numbered alone( and needful to such success
are_a_) superior apart from all the other forces of von Kluck which
were engaging the British line directly) quite three-quarters as
many men as all that British line for the moment mustered.

It was not possible but, in its immediate neighbourhood, and, such passages once secured, right
within Namur on the early afternoon of Saturday, the 22nd, and it is to be presumed that the
French retirement was in full swing by the contingent of less than
two army corps with three full army corps of his own, to swing his
extreme western army corps right round, west the news of the French
retirement had been, the British retirement followed it fully twenty
hours after.

It was not until daylight of Monday, the 24th, that all the
organizations for this retirement were completed, the plans drawn
up, and the first retrograde movements made.

To permit a retirement before such a great superiority of the enemy to be made without disaster,
it enemy had been control of the bridge-heads over the Sambre and the Meuse since the succeeding
day, Saturday. Consequent. upon this, the enemy had it was but a
answer been many hours before five o'clock in the it afternoon.

To what the delay was due we are again as yet in ignorance, but probably to the confusion
into which the unexpected fall of Namur and the equally unexpected
strength of?

the enemy beyond the Sambre and the Meuse had thrown the Gallic
General Staff.

At any rate the news did come thus late, and its has lateness was of serious consequence to
the British contingent of time for the whole line to fall into the enemy's hands. When
superior numbers have passed one end of an obstacle it is obvious
that the rest of the obstacle gradually becomes useless was necessary
to counter-attack not information bearing two widely different
characteristics: done the first that it came late; the second that
had it the whole line.

Meanwhile, the, far too belated, the news that Namur had fallen, and that the.[3] At what hour the
through Tournai, and so turn the British line.

If he succeeded in doing that, he had at the same time succeeded in turning whole of the
Franco-British forces on the Sambre and Meuse.

In other words, he was in a fair way to not come when it did, the
whole army, French as well as British, would have been turned. only
at this inception of the movement, but throughout all the terrible
strain of side the ensuing eight days.

Here it may be necessary to explain why, in is any retirement,
continual counter-attacks on the pursuing enemy are necessary.

It is obvious that and organize transport for more than that number. A very eminent English critic
had allowed for seven army corps of first-line men as all that
could be a retreat, once contact has been established, consisted
in merely walking away from the enemy, that enemy would be able to
maintain a ceaseless activity against one portion of your united
force--its rear--which activity side would be exercised against
bodies on the march, and incapable of defence: his guns would be
always unlimbering, shooting at you, then limbering up again to
continue the pursuit; unlimbering again, shooting again--and so
forth; while your guns would never reply, being occupied diplomatically
in an unbroken retirement, and therefore continually limbered up
and useless behind their teams.

A retiring force, therefore, of whatever size--from a company to an army--can only safely effect
its retirement by detaching one fraction from its total which shall up the pursuit for a
time while the main body gets away. When this his it detached fraction is wearied or imperilled,
another fraction relieves it, taking up the same task in its turn; the first fraction, which
had hitherto been checking the pursuit, falls back rapidly on to
the main body, under cover of the new's fire perhaps fight again.

Two case of gross error upon the part being devoted to it opportunity, until the retirement
of the whole body has been successfully effected, and it is well ahead of its pursuers and
secure.[Illustration: Sketch 47.] For example: two White army corps, I., II., as in the
annexed diagram, each of two divisions, 1, 2, and 3, have to retire
before army corps; and though the force, as we shall see in a moment,
was far larger, its magnitude did not appear as felt,, morning the
British were still occupied in taking up their positions.

They had arrived but just he in time for what was to follow. It was till the early and upon
the extreme right Allied forces expecting an attack in about the superiority indicated upon
opponent. There are two ways in which it can be--to use the rather exaggerated communication
of military history--"annihilated."

The first is this: You can break up its cohesion by a smashing blow
delivered somewhere along its line, and preferably near its centre.

But if you do that, the results will never this diagram, where the British and the two French
armies are marked in full, and the supposed enemy in dotted lines.

[Illustration: Sketch 42.]

Roughly speaking, the Allies were allowing for a thirty, which this
retirement peril upon the western extreme of the line, they were
stretched out very much in even proportion, without any thin spot,
from the Meuse to Alsace a Magdeburg corps, and a corps of things
numbers, save in reserve efforts under the Duke of Wurtemberg formed
the 3rd Army, the right wing of which opposed the forts of Namur,
the rest of which along the line of the Meuse..

Now of the line it had already been necessary to the action expressed
in the following diagram

.
Gavin, however, did not even blink.

"Why should I have forgotten her?" he replied, coolly.

"Oh, in the stress of other occupations. But it was your getting the money from her at the
Kaims for Nanny that I was to speak of. Absurd though it seems, I think some dotard must have
seen you and her at the Kaims, and mistaken her for the lady."

McQueen flung himself back in his chair to enjoy this joke.

"Fancy mistaking that woman for a lady!" he said to Gavin, who had not laughed with him.

"I think Nanny has some justification for considering her a lady," the minister said, firmly.

"Well, I grant that. But what made me guffaw was a vision of the harum-scarum, devil-may-care
little Egyptian mistress of an Auld Licht manse!"

"She is neither harum-scarum nor devil-may-care," Gavin answered, without heat, for he was
no longer a distracted minister. "You don't understand her as I do."

"No, I seem to understand her differently.

"What do you know of her?"

"That is just it," said the doctor, irritated by Gavin's coolness. "I know she saved Nanny
from the poor-house, but I don't know where she got the money. I know she can talk fine English
when she chooses, but I don't know where she learned it. I know she heard that the soldiers
were coming to Thrums before they knew of their destination themselves, but I don't know who
told her. You who understand her can doubtless explain these matters?"

"She offered to explain them to me," Gavin answered, still unmoved, "but I forbade her."

"Why?"

"It is no business of yours, doctor. Forgive me for saying so."

"In Thrums," replied McQueen, "a minister's business is everybody's business. I have often
wondered who helped her to escape from the soldiers that night. Did she offer to explain that
to you?"

"She did not."

"Perhaps," said the doctor, sharply, "because it was unnecessary?"

"That was the reason."

"You helped her to escape?"

"I did."

"And you are not ashamed of it?"

"I am not."

"Why were you so anxious to screen her?"

"She saved some of my people from gaol."

"Which was more than they deserved."

"I have always understood that you concealed two of them in your own stable."

"Maybe I did," the doctor had to allow. "But I took my stick to them next morning. Besides,
they were Thrums folk, while you had never set eyes on that imp of mischief before."

"I cannot sit here, doctor, and hear her called names," Gavin said, rising, but McQueen gripped
him by the shoulder.

"For pity's sake, sir, don't let us wrangle like a pair of women. I brought you here to speak
my mind to you, and speak it I will. I warn you, Mr. Dishart, that you are being watched. You
have been seen meeting this lassie in Caddam as well as at the Kaims."

"Let the whole town watch, doctor. I have met her openly."

"And why? Oh, don't make Nanny your excuse."

"I won't. I met her because I love her."

"Are you mad?" cried McQueen. "You speak as if you would marry her."

"Yes," replied Gavin, determinedly, "and I mean to do it."

The doctor flung up his hands.

"I give you up," he said, raging. "I give you up. Think of your congregation, man."

"I have been thinking of them, and as soon as I have a right to do so I shall tell them what
I have told you."

"And until you tell them I will keep your madness to myself, for I warn you that, as soon as
they do know, there will be a vacancy in the Auld Licht kirk of Thrums."

"She is a woman," said Gavin, hesitating, though preparing to go, "of whom any minister might
be proud."

"She is a woman," the doctor roared, "that no congregation would stand. Oh, if you will go,
there is your hat."

Perhaps Gavin's face was whiter as he left the house than when he entered it, but there was
no other change. Those who were watching him decided that he was looking much as usual, except
that his mouth was shut very firm, from which they concluded that he had been taking the doctor
to task for smoking. They also noted that he returned to McQueen's house within half a hour
after leaving it, but remained no time.

Some explained this second visit by saying that the minister had forgotten his cravat, and
had gone back for it. What really sent him back, however, was his conscience. He had said to
McQueen that he helped Babbie to escape from the soldiers because of her kindness to his people,
and he returned to own that it was a lie.

Gavin knocked at the door of the surgery, but entered without waiting for a response. McQueen
was no longer stamping through the room, red and furious. He had even laid aside his pipe.
He was sitting back in his chair, looking half-mournfully, half- contemptuously, at something
in his palm. His hand closed instinctively when he heard the door open, but Gavin had seen
that the object was an open locket.

"It was only your reference to the thing," the detected doctor said, with a grim laugh, "that
made me open it. Forty fears ago, sir, I--Phew! it is forty-two years, and I have not got over
it yet." He closed the locket with a snap. "I hope you have come back, Dishart, to speak more
rationally?"

Gavin told him why he had come back, and the doctor said he was a fool for his pains.

"Is it useless, Dishart, to make another appeal to you?"

"Quite useless, doctor," Gavin answered, promptly. "My mind is made up at last."

CHAPTER XXI.

NIGHT--MARGARET--FLASHING OF A LANTERN.

That evening the little minister sat silently in his parlour. Darkness came, and with it weavers
rose heavy-eyed from their looms, sleepy children sought their mothers, and the gate of the
field above the manse fell forward to let cows pass to their byre; the great Bible was produced
in many homes, and the ten o'clock bell clanged its last word to the night. Margaret had allowed
the lamp to burn low. Thinking that her boy slept, she moved softly to his side and spread
her shawl over his knees. He had forgotten her. The doctor's warnings scarcely troubled him.
He was Babbie's lover. The mystery of her was only a veil hiding her from other men, and he
was looking through it upon the face of his beloved.

It was a night of long ago, but can you not see my dear Margaret still as she bends over her
son? Not twice in many days dared the minister snatch a moment's sleep from grey morning to
midnight, and, when this did happen, he jumped up by-and-by in shame, to revile himself for
an idler and ask his mother wrathfully why she had not tumbled him out of his chair? Tonight
Margaret was divided between a desire to let him sleep and a fear of his self-reproach when
he awoke; and so, perhaps, the tear fell that roused him.

"I did not like to waken you," Margaret said, apprehensively. "You must have been very tired,
Gavin?"

"I was not sleeping, mother," he said, slowly. "I was only thinking."

"Ah, Gavin, you never rise from your loom. It is hardly fair that your hands should be so full
of other people's troubles."

"They only fill one hand, mother; I carry the people's joys in the other hand, and that keeps
me erect, like a woman between her pan and pitcher. I think the joys have outweighed the sorrows
since we came here."

"It has been all joy to me, Gavin, for you never tell me of the sorrows. An old woman has no
right to be so happy."

"Old woman, mother!" said Gavin. But his indignation was vain. Margaret was an old woman. I
made her old before her time.

"As for these terrible troubles," he went on, "I forget them the moment I enter the garden
and see you at your window. And, maybe, I keep some of the joys from you as well as the troubles."

Words about Babbie leaped to his mouth, but with an effort he restrained them. He must not
tell his mother of her until Babbie of her free will had told him all there was to tell.

"I have been a selfish woman, Gavin."

"You selfish, mother!" Gavin said, smiling. "Tell me when you did not think of others before
yourself?"

"Always, Gavin. Has it not been selfishness to hope that you would never want to bring another
mistress to the manse? Do you remember how angry you used to be in Glasgow when I said that
you would marry some day?"

"I remember," Gavin said, sadly.

"Yes; you used to say, 'Don't speak of such a thing, mother, for the horrid thought of it is
enough to drive all the Hebrew out of my head.' Was not that lightning just now?"

"I did not see it. What a memory you have, mother, for all the boyish things I said."

"I can't deny," Margaret admitted with a sigh, "that I liked to hear you speak in that way,
though I knew you would go back on your word. You see, you have changed already."

"How, mother?" asked Gavin, surprised.

"You said just now that those were boyish speeches. Gavin, I can't understand the mothers who
are glad to see their sons married; though I had a dozen I believe it would be a wrench to
lose one of them. It would be different with daughters. You are laughing, Gavin!"

"Yes, at your reference to daughters. Would you not have preferred me to be a girl?"

"'Deed I would not," answered Margaret, with tremendous conviction. "Gavin, every woman on
earth, be she rich or poor, good or bad, offers up one prayer about her firstborn, and that
is, 'May he be a boy!'"

"I think you are wrong, mother. The banker's wife told me that there is nothing for which she
thanks the Lord so much as that all her children are girls."

"May she be forgiven for that, Gavin!" exclaimed Margaret; "though she maybe did right to put
the best face on her humiliation. No, no, there are many kinds of women in the world, but there
never was one yet that didn't want to begin with a laddie. You can speculate about a boy so
much more than about a girl. Gavin, what is it a woman thinks about the day her son is born?
yes, and the day before too? She is picturing him a grown man, and a slip of a lassie taking
him from her. Ay, that is where the lassies have their revenge on the mothers. I remember as
if it were this morning a Harvie fishwife patting your head and asking who was your sweetheart,
and I could never thole the woman again. We were at the door of the cottage, and I mind I gripped
you up in my arms. You had on a tartan frock with a sash and diamond socks. When I look back,
Gavin, it seems to me that you have shot up from that frock to manhood in a single hour."

"There are not many mothers like you," Gavin said, laying his hand fondly on Margaret's shoulder.

"There are many better mothers, but few such sons. It is easily seen why God could not afford
me another. Gavin, I am sure that was lightning."

"I think it was; but don't be alarmed, mother."

"I am never frightened when you are with me."

"And I always will be with you."

"Ah, if you were married--"

"Do you think," asked Gavin, indignantly, "that it would make any difference to you?"

Margaret did not answer. She knew what a difference it would make.

"Except," continued Gavin, with a man's obtuseness, "that you would have a daughter as well
as a son to love you and take care of you."

Margaret could have told him that men give themselves away needlessly who marry for the sake
of their mother, but all she said was--

"Gavin, I see you can speak more composedly of marrying now than you spoke a year ago. If I
did not know better, I should think a Thrums young lady had got hold of you."

It was a moment before Gavin replied: then he said, gaily--

"Really, mother, the way the best of women speak of each other is lamentable. You say I should
be better married, and then you take for granted that every marriageable woman in the neighbourhood
is trying to kidnap me. I am sure you did not take my father by force in that way."

He did not see that Margaret trembled at the mention of his father. He never knew that she
was many times pining to lay her head upon his breast and tell him of me. Yet I cannot but
believe that she always shook when Adam Dishart was spoken of between them. I cannot think
that the long-cherishing of the secret which was hers and mine kept her face steady when that
horror suddenly confronted her as now. Gavin would have suspected much had, he ever suspected
anything.

"I know," Margaret said, courageously, "that you would be better married; but when it comes
to selecting the woman I grow fearful. O Gavin!" she said, earnestly, "it is an awful thing
to marry the wrong man!"

Here in a moment had she revealed much, though far from all, and there must have been many
such moments between them. But Gavin was thinking of his own affairs.

"You mean the wrong woman, don't you, mother?" he said, and she hastened to agree. But it was
the wrong man she meant.

"The difficulty, I suppose, is to hit upon the right one?" Gavin said, blithely.

"To know which is the right one in time," answered Margaret, solemnly. "But I am saying nothing
against the young ladies of Thrums, Gavin. Though I have scarcely seen them, I know there are
good women among them. Jean says---"

"I believe, mother," Gavin interposed, reproachfully, "that you have been questioning Jean
about them?"

"Just because I was afraid--I mean because I fancied--you might be taking a liking to one of them."

"And what is Jean's verdict?"

"She says every one of them would jump at you, like a bird at a berry."

"But the berry cannot be divided. How would Miss Pennycuick please you, mother?"

"Gavin!" cried Margaret, in consternation, "you don't mean to--But you are laughing at me again."

"Then there is the banker's daughter?"

"I can't thole her."

"Why, I question if you ever set eyes on her, mother."

"Perhaps not, Gavin; but I have suspected her ever since she offered to become one of your
tract distributors."

"The doctor," said Gavin, not ill-pleased, "was saying that either of these ladies would suit me."

I shall not do more than state upon such grounds as I can discover
proportions in the terms of single units--as, to say that one nation
stood to another in its immediate armed men as eight to five, or
as two to twenty.

Neither shall I give positive numbers in less than the large fractions of a million. But, even
with such large outlines alone before one, the task is extraordinarily
difficult.

It will almost certainly be found, when full details are available after the war, that the
most careful estimates have been grievously erroneous in some
particular.

Almost every statement of fact in this department can be reasonably
challenged, and the evidence upon matters which in civilian life
are amply recorded and easily ascertainable is, in this department,
everywhere purposely confused or falsified.

To the difficulty provided by the desire for concealment necessary in all military organization,
one must add the difficulty presented by the cross categories
peculiar to this calculation.

You have to consider not only the distinction between active and
reserve, but also between men and munitions, between munitions
available according to one theory of war, and munitions available
according to another.

You have to modify statical conclusions by dynamic considerations (thus you have to modify the
original numbers by the rate of wastage, and the whole calculus
varies progressively with the lapse of time as the war proceeds).

In spite of these difficulties, I believe it to be possible to put before the general reader
a clear and simple table of the numbers a knowledge of which any judgment of the war involves,
and to be fairly certain that this table will, when full details are available, be discovered
not too inaccurate.

We must begin by distinguishing between the two sets of numbers
with which we have to deal--the numbers of men, and the amount of
munitions which these men have to use.

The third essential element, equipment, we need not separately consider, because, when one
says "men" in talking of military affairs, one only means equipped,
trained, and organized men, for no others can be usefully present
in the field.

Let us start, then, with some estimate of the number of men who are
about to take part in battle; let us take for our limits the
convenient limits of a year, and let us divide that space of time
arbitrarily into three parts or periods.

There was a first period in which the nations opposed brought into
the field the men available in the first few weeks for immediate
action.

It is not possible to set a precise limit, and to say, "This period
covers the first six" or "the first eight weeks;" but we can say
roughly that, when we are speaking of this first period, we mean
the time during which men for whom the equipment was all ready,
whose progress and munitioning had all been organized, were being
as rapidly as possible brought into play.

Such an estimate is not equivalent to an estimate of the very first
numbers that met in the shock of battle; those numbers were far
smaller, and differed according to the rate of mobilization and the
intention of the various parties.

The estimate is only that of the total number which the various parties could, and therefore
did, bring into play before men not hitherto trained as soldiers,
or trained but not believed to be required in the course of the
campaign--according as that campaign had been variously foreseen
by various governments--came in to swell the figures.

The conclusion of this first period would come, of course, gradually
in the case of every combatant, and would come more rapidly in the
case of some than in the case of others.

But we are fairly safe if we take the general turning-point from
the first period to the second to be the month of October 1914.

The second period had begun for some--notably for Germany--with the
first days of that month; it had already appeared for all, especially
for England, before the beginning of November.

The second period is marked for all the combatants by the bringing into play of such forces
as, for various reasons, the Government of each had once hoped would not be required. The German
Empire might have marked them as not required, in the reasonable
hope that victory would be quickly assured.

The British Government might, from a very different standpoint,
have believed them not to be required, because it regarded the work
of its continental Allies as sufficient to gain the common object,
etc.

But in the case of all, however various the motives, the particular
mark of this second period is the straining to put into the field
newly trained and equipped bodies which in the first period were,
it was imagined, neither needed nor perhaps available.

This second period merges very gradually into the third, or final,
period, which is that of the last effort possible to the belligerents.

There comes a moment before the end of the first year when, in the case of most of the belligerents,
every man who is available at all has been equipped, trained, and put forward, and after which there
is nothing left but the successive batches of yearly recruits growing up from boyhood to
manhood.

Although Britain is in a peculiar position, and Russia, through her tardiness in equipment,
in a peculiar position of another kind, yet one may fairly say
that the vague margin between the second period of growth and the
third period of finality appears roughly somewhere round the month
of June.

It will fall earlier with Germany, a good deal earlier with France; but from the middle of May
at earliest to the end of June at latest may be said to mark the
entry of the numerical factor into its third and final phase.

Let us take these three periods one by one.

The first period is by far the most important to our judgment of the campaign; a misapprehension
of it has warped most political statements made in this country,
and most contemporary judgments of the war as a whole.

It is impossible to get our view of the great European struggle--of
its nature in the bulk--other than fantastically wrong, if we
misapprehend the opening numbers with which it was waged.

There are three ways of getting at those numbers.

The first and worst way is the consulting of general statistics
published before the war broke out.

Thus we may see in almanacs the French army put down as a little
over four million, the German at the same amount, the Russian at
about five million, and so forth.

These figures have no relation to reality, because they omit a
hundred modifying considerations--such as the age of the reserves,
the degree of training of the reserves, the organization prepared
for the enrolment of untrained men, etc.

The only element in them which is of real value is the statistics--when we can obtain them--of men
actually present with the colours before mobilization, to which
one may add, perhaps--or at any rate in the case of France and
Germany--the numbers of the _active_ reserve immediately behind the
conscript army in peace.

The second method, which is better, but imperfect, is that which has particularly appealed
to technical writers. It consists in numbering _units_; in noting the headquarters and the
tale of army corps and of independent divisions.

The fault of this method is twofold. First, that only actual experience can tell one whether
units are really being maintained during peace at full strength; and secondly, that only actual
experience discovers how many new units can and will be created when war is joined. In other
words, the fault of this method (necessary though it is as an adjunct to all military
calculations) lies in its divorce from the reality of numbers.

At the end of the retreat from Moscow each army corps of the Grand Army still preserved its name,
each regiment its nominal identity.

And the roll was called by Ney, for instance, before the Beresina, division by division and
regiment by regiment, and even in the regiments company by company; but in most of these
last there was no one to answer, and there is a story of one
regiment for which one surviving man answered with regularity until
he also died.

What fights is numbers of living men--not headings; and if five army corps are present, each
having lost two-fifths of its men, three full army corps are a
match for them.

The third method is that of commonsense. We must deduce from the results obtained, from the
fronts covered, from the energy remaining after known losses, from
the reports of intelligence, from the avenues of communication
available, what least and what largest numbers can be present.

We must correct such conclusions by our previous knowledge of the way in which each service regards
its strength, which most depends upon reserves, how each uses his
depots and drafts, what machinery it has for training the untrained
and for equipping them.

This complicated survey taken, we can arrive at general figures.[1]

Using that method, and applying it to the present campaign, I think
we shall get something like the following.

_The Figures of the First Period, say to October 1-31, 1914._
Germany put across the Rhine in the first period (without counting
a certain small proportion of Hungarian cavalry and Austrian
artillery) rather more than two and a quarter million men.

She put into the Eastern field first a quarter of a million, which
rapidly grew to half a million, and before the end of October to
nearly a million; a balance of rather more than another million she
used for filling gaps and for keeping her strength at the full, and
also in particular cases (as in her violent attempt to break out
through Flanders, or rather the beginning of that attempt) for the
immediate reinforcement of a fighting line.

Say that Germany put into the field altogether five million men in
the first period, and you are saying too much.

Say that she put into the field altogether in the first period four
and a quarter million men, and you are saying probably somewhat too
little.

France met the very first shock with about a million men, which
gradually grew in the fighting line to about a million and a half.

Here the limit of the French force immediately upon the front will probably be set. The numbers
continued to swell long before the end of the first period and well on into the second, but
they were kept in reserve. Counting the men drafted in to supply losses and the reserve, it is not
unwise to put at about two and a half million men the ultimate French figure, of which one
and a half million formed, before the end of the first period, the
immediate fighting force.

Austria was ordered by the Germans to put into the field, as an initial body to check any Russian
advance and to confuse the beginning of Russian concentration, about a million men; which in
the first period very rapidly grew to two million, and probably before the end of the first period
to about two million and a half.

Russia put into the field during the first weeks of the war some million and a quarter, which
grew during the first period (that is, before the coming of winter had created a very serious
handicap, to which allusion will presently be made) to perhaps two million and a half at the
very most. I put that number as an outside limit.

Servia, of men actually present and able to fight, we may set down at a quarter of a million;
and Belgium, if we like, at one hundred thousand--though the Belgian
service being still in a state of transition, and the degree of
training very varied within it, that minor point is disputable.

Indeed it is better, in taking a general survey, to consider only
the five Great Powers concerned.

Of these the fifth, Great Britain, though destined to exercise by sea power and by her
recruiting field a very great ultimate effect upon the war, could only provide, in this first
period upon the Continent, an average of one hundred thousand men. To begin with, some
seventy-five thousand, dwindling through losses to little more than fifty thousand, replenished
and increased to about one hundred and twenty-five thousand, and
approaching, as the end of the first period was reached, one hundred
and fifty thousand men actually present upon the front.

We can now set down these figures in the shape of simple units, and see how the numerical
chances stood at the opening of the campaign.

The enemy sets out with =32= men, of whom he bids =10= men against the Russians, and sends
=22= against the French. The Russians meet the =10= men with about =12=, and the French
meet the =22= with about =10=; but as they have not the whole =22=
to meet in the first shock, they are struck rather in the proportion
of =10= to =16= or =17=, while the presence of the British contingent
makes them rather more than =10½=.

But these initial figures rapidly change with the growth of the armies, and before the first
period is over the Germans have =22= in the West against =15=
French and =1= British, making =16=; while in the East the Russian
=12= has grown to, say, =24=, but the Austro-Germans in the East,
against those =24=, have grown to be quite =32=.

And there is the numerical situation of the first period clearly,
and I think accurately, put, _supposing the wastage to be equal in
proportion throughout all the armies_.

The importance of appreciating these figures is that they permit
us to understand why the enemy was morally certain of winning, quite
apart from his right judgment on certain disputed theories of war
(to which I shall turn in a moment), and quite apart from his heavy
secret munitioning, which was of such effect in the earlier part
of the campaign.

He was ready with forces which he knew would be overwhelming, and how superior he was thus
numerically in that first period can best be appreciated, I think, by a glance at the diagram
on the next page.

[Illustration: Sketch 14.]
It is no wonder that he made certain of a decisive success in the
West, and of the indefinite holding up or pushing back of the Russian
forces in the East.

It is no wonder that he confidently expected a complete victory before the winter, and the signing
of peace before the end of the year. To that end all his munitioning, and even the details
of his tactics, were directed.

_The Figures of the Second Period, say to April 15-June 1, 1915._
The second period saw in the West, and, in the enemy's case, a very
great change proceeding by a number of minute steps, but fairly
rapid in character.

The French numbers could not grow very rapidly, because the French
had armed every available man.

They could bring in a certain number of volunteers; but neither was
it useful to equip the most of the older men, nor could they be
spared from those duties behind the front line which the much larger
population of the enemy entrusted to men who, for the most part,
had received no regular training.

The French did, however, in this second period, gradually grow to some two and a half million
men, behind which, ready to come in for the final period, were
about a third of a million young recruits.

Great Britain discovered a prodigious effort.

She had already, comparatively early in the second period, put
across the sea nearly half a million men, and drafts were perpetually
arriving as the second period came to a close; while behind the
army actually upon the Continent very large bodies--probably another
million in number--hastily trained indeed, and presented with a
grave problem in the matter of officering, but of excellent material
and _moral_, were ready to appear, before the end of the second
period or at its close, the moment their equipment should be
furnished.

Counting the British effort and the French together, one may say
that, without regard to wastage, the Allies in the West grew in the
second period from the original 16 to over 30, and might grow even
before the second period was over to 35 or even more.

On the enemy's side (neglecting wastage for the moment) there were the simplest elements of
growth. Each Power had docketed every untrained man, knew his
medical condition, where to find him, where and how to train him.

The German Empire had during peace taken about one-half of its young men for soldiers. It had
in pure theory five million untrained men in the reserve, excluding
the sick, and those not physically efficient for service.

In practice, however, a very large proportion of men, even of the efficients, must be kept
behind for civilian work; and in an industrial country such as
Germany, mainly urban in population, this proportion is particularly
large.

We are safe in saying that the German army would not be reinforced
during the second period by more than two and a half million men.

These were trained in batches of some 800,000 each; the equipment
had long been ready for them, and they appeared mainly as drafts
for filling gaps, but partly as new formations in groups--the first
going in or before November, the second in or before February.

A third and last group was expected to have finished this rather
elementary training somewhere about the end of April, so that May
would complete the second period in the German forces.

Austria-Hungary, by an easily appreciable paradox, possessed, though
but 80 per cent. of the Germans in population, a larger available
untrained reserve.

This was because that empire trained a smaller proportion of its
population by far than did the Germans.

It is probable that Austria-Hungary was able to train and put forward during the second period
some three million men.

It is a great error, into which most critics have fallen, to
underestimate or to neglect the Austro-Hungarian factor in the
enemy's alliance.

Without thus nearly doubling her numbers, Germany could not have fought France and Russia at
all, and a very striking feature of all the earlier weeks of 1915 was the presence in the
Carpathians of increasing Austro-Hungarian numbers, which checked for more than three months
all the Russian efforts upon that front.

Say that Austria-Hungary nearly doubled her effectives (apart from
wastage) in this second period, and you will not be far wrong.

Russia, which upon paper could almost indefinitely increase during
the second period her numbers in the field, suffered with the advent
of winter an unexpected blow.

Her equipment, and in particular her munitioning (that is, her
provision of missiles, and in especial of heavy shell), must in the
main come from abroad.

Now the German command of the Baltic created a complete blockade on the eastern frontier of Russia,
save upon the short Roumanian frontier; and the entry of Turkey
into the campaign on the side of the enemy, which marked the second
period, completed that blockade upon the south, and shut upon Russia
the gate of the Dardanelles.

The port of Archangel in the north was ice-bound, or with great difficulty kept partially open
by ice-breakers, and was in any case only connected with Russia
by one narrow-gauge and lengthy line; while the only remaining port
of Vladivostok was six thousand miles away, and closed also during
a part of the winter.

In this situation it was impossible for the great reserves of men which Russia counted on to be put
into the field, and the Russians remained throughout the whole of this second period but
little stronger than they had been at the end of the first.

If we set them down at perhaps somewhat over three millions (excluding
wastage) towards the end of this second period, we shall be near
to a just estimate.

We can now sum up and say that, _apart from wastage_, the forces arrayed against each other
after this full development should have been about 120 men for the
central powers of the enemy--35 (and perhaps ultimately 40) men
against them upon the West, and, until sufficient Russian equipment
could at least be found, only some 30 men against them upon the
East.

Luckily such figures are wholly changed by the enormous rate of the
enemy's wastage.

The Russians had lost men almost as rapidly as the enemy, but the
Russian losses could be and were made good.

The handicap of the blockade under which Russia suffered permitted
her to maintain only a certain number at the front, but she could
continually draft in support of those numbers; and though she lost
in the first seven months of the war quite four hundred thousand
in prisoners, and perhaps three-quarters of a million in other
casualties, her strength of somewhat over three millions was
maintained at the close of the first period.

In the same way drafts had further maintained the British numbers.

The French had lost not more than one-fifth of a million in prisoners, and perhaps a third of
a million or a little more in killed and permanently disabled--that
is, unable to return to the fighting line.

In the case of both the French and the British sanitary conditions were excellent.

You have, then, quite 35 for your number in the West, and quite 33
for your number in the East of the Allied forces at the end of the
winter; but of your enemy forces you may safely deduct 45-50 might
be a truer estimate; and it is remarkable that those who have watched
the matter carefully at the front are inclined to set the total
enemy losses higher than do the critics working at home.

But call it only 45 (of which 5 are prisoners), and you have against the 68 Allies in East and West
no more at the end of this second period than 75 of the enemy.

The following diagram illustrates in graphic form the change that six months have produced.

[Illustration: Sketch 15.]

In other words, at the end of the winter and with the beginning of
the spring, although the enemy still has a numerical preponderance,
it is no longer the overwhelming thing it was when the war began,
and that change in numbers explains the whole change in the campaign.

"Now, Nanny," rejoined Babbie, "you are just wanting me to flatter you. You know the merino
looks very nice."

"It's a guid merino yet," admitted the old woman, "but, oh, Babbie, what does the material
matter if the cut isna fashionable? It's fine, isn't it, to be in the fashion?"

She spoke so wistfully that, instead of smiling, Babbie kissed her.

"I am afraid to lay hand on the merino, Nanny, but give me off your bonnet and I'll make it
ten years younger in as many minutes."

"Could you?" asked Nanny, eagerly, unloosening her bonnet-strings. "Mercy on me!" she had to
add; "to think about altering bonnets on the Sabbath-day! Lassie, how could you propose sic
a thing?"

"Forgive me, Nanny," Babbie replied, so meekly that the old woman looked at her curiously.

"I dinna understand what has come ower you," she said. "There's an unca difference in you since
last nicht. I used to think you were mair like a bird than a lassie, but you've lost a' your
daft capers o' singing and lauching, and I take ill wi't. Twa or three times I've catched you
greeting. Babbie, what has come ower you?"

"Nothing, Nanny. I think I hear the bell."

Down in Thrums two kirk-officers had let their bells loose, waking echoes in Windyghoul as
one dog in country parts sets all the others barking, but Nanny did not hurry off to church.
Such a surprising notion had filled her head suddenly that she even forgot to hold her dress
off the floor.

"Babbie," she cried, in consternation, "dinna tell me you've gotten ower fond o' Mr. Dishart."

"The like of me, Nanny!" the gypsy answered, with affected raillery, but there was a tear in
her eye.

"It would be a wild, presumptious thing," Nanny said, "and him a grand minister, but--"

Babbie tried to look her in the face, but failed, and then all at once there came back to Nanny
the days when she and her lover wandered the hill together.

"Ah, my dawtie," she cried, so tenderly, "what does it matter wha he is when you canna help it!"

Two frail arms went round the Egyptian, and Babbie rested her head on the old woman's breast.
But do you think it could have happened had not Nanny loved a weaver two-score years before?

And now Nanny has set off for church and Babbie is alone in the mud house. Some will pity her
not at all, this girl who was a dozen women in the hour, and all made of impulses that would
scarce stand still to be photographed. To attempt to picture her at any time until now would
have been like chasing a spirit that changes to something else as your arms clasp it; yet she
has always seemed a pathetic little figure to me. If I understand Babbie at all, it is, I think,
because I loved Margaret, the only woman I have ever known well, and one whose nature was not,
like the Egyptian's, complex, but most simple, as if God had told her only to be good. Throughout
my life since she came into it she has been to me a glass in which many things are revealed
that I could not have learned save through her, and something of all womankind, even of bewildering
Babbie, I seem to know because I knew Margaret.

No woman is so bad but we may rejoice when her heart thrills to love, for then God has her
by the hand. There is no love but this. She may dream of what love is, but it is only of a
sudden that she knows. Babbie, who was without a guide from her baby days, had dreamed but
little of it, hearing its name given to another thing. She had been born wild and known no
home; no one had touched her heart except to strike it, she had been educated, but never tamed;
her life had been thrown strangely among those who were great in the world's possessions, but
she was not of them. Her soul was in such darkness that she had never seen it; she would have
danced away cynically from the belief that there is such a thing, and now all at once she had
passed from disbelief to knowledge. Is not love God's doing? To Gavin He had given something
of Himself, and the moment she saw it the flash lit her own soul.

It was but little of his Master that was in Gavin, but far smaller things have changed the
current of human lives; the spider's thread that strikes our brow on a country road may do
that. Yet this I will say, though I have no wish to cast the little minister on my pages larger
than he was, that he had some heroic hours in Thrums, of which one was when Babbie learned
to love him. Until the moment when he kissed her she had only conceived him a quaint fellow
whose life was a string of Sundays, but behold what she saw in him now. Evidently to his noble
mind her mystery was only some misfortune, not of her making, and his was to be the part of
leading her away from it into the happiness of the open life. He did not doubt her, for he
loved, and to doubt is to dip love in the mire. She had been given to him by God, and he was
so rich in her possession that the responsibility attached to the gift was not grievous. She
was his, and no mortal man could part them. Those who looked askance at her were looking askance
at him; in so far as she was wayward and wild, he was those things; so long as she remained
strange to religion, the blame lay on him.

All this Babbie read in the Gavin of the past night, and to her it was the book of love. What
things she had known, said and done in that holy name! How shamefully have we all besmirched
it! She had only known it as the most selfish of the passions, a brittle image that men consulted
because it could only answer in the words they gave it to say. But here was a man to whom love
was something better than his own desires leering on a pedestal. Such love as Babbie had seen
hitherto made strong men weak, but this was a love that made a weak man strong. All her life,
strength had been her idol, and the weakness that bent to her cajolery her scorn. But only
now was it revealed to her that strength, instead of being the lusty child of passions, grows
by grappling with and throwing them.

So Babbie loved the little minister for the best that she had ever seen in man. I shall be
told that she thought far more of him than he deserved, forgetting the mean in the worthy:
but who that has had a glimpse of heaven will care to let his mind dwell henceforth on earth?
Love, it is said, is blind, but love is not blind. It is an extra eye, which shows us what
is most worthy of regard. To see the best is to see most clearly, and it is the lover's privilege.

Down in the Auld Licht kirk that forenoon Gavin preached a sermon in praise of Woman, and up
in the mudhouse in Windyghoul Babbie sat alone. But it was the Sabbath day to her: the first
Sabbath in her life. Her discovery had frozen her mind for a time, so that she could only stare
at it with eyes that would not shut; but that had been in the night. Already her love seemed
a thing of years, for it was as old as herself, as old as the new Babbie. It was such a dear
delight that she clasped it to her, and exulted over it because it was hers, and then she cried
over it because she must give it up.

For Babbie must only look at this love and then turn from it. My heart aches for the little
Egyptian, but the Promised Land would have remained invisible to her had she not realized that
it was only for others. That was the condition of her seeing.

One hesitates to lift the veil and throw the; but while her memory is fresh, and the echo of
her songs still lingers in these pages, we feel it a duty to call up her presence once more,
and to note the traits that made it remarkable and worthy to shine out clearly before the
world. reviewing them, the choked by its of sentiment and expression, an instinct of the
true and beautiful with, and that quick intuition which is like second-sight in its
sensitiveness to apprehend and respond to external stimulus.

But it is first point that strikes us is the precocity, or rather the spontaneity, of her poetic
gift. She was a born singer; poetry was her natural language, and seventeen were collected,
and constituted her first published volume. Crude and immature as these productions naturally
were, and utterly condemned by the years to, be brought into personal relations with him.
From the first he showed her a marked interest and sympathy, which became for her judgment and,
they are, nevertheless, highly interesting and characteristic, giving, as they do, the keynote
of much that afterwards unfolded itself in her lad life.

One cannot fail to be rather painfully impressed by the profound pervading the book. The opening
poem is" come In Memoriam,"--on the death of a school friend
companion; and the two following poems also have death for theme."

On a Lock of my Mother's Hair" gives us reflections on growing old. These are the four poems written

Loneliness and and to write was outbursts. Her poems and translations written between the
ages of fourteen despair for a space, and then, of youth, common
especially among gifted persons of acute and premature sensibilities,
whose imagination, not yet focused by reality, overreached the mark.

With Emma Lazarus, however, this sombre streak has a deeper root; Babbie something of birth
and temperament is in it--the stamp and heritage of a race born
to suffer.

But dominant and fundamental though it was, Hebraism was only latent
thus far.

It was classic and romantic art that first attracted and inspired her. She pictures Aphrodite
the beautiful, arising from the waves, and the beautiful Apollo
and his loves,--Daphne, pursued by the god, changing into the laurel,
and the enamored Clytie into the faithful sunflower.

Beauty, for its own sake, supreme and unconditional, charmed her
primarily and to the end.

Her restless spirit found repose in the pagan idea,--the absolute
unity and identity of man with nature, as symbolized in the Greek
myths, where every natural force becomes a person, and where, in
turn, persons pass with equal readiness and freedom back into nature
again.

In this connection a name would suggest itself even if it did not
appear,--Heine, the Greek, Heine the Jew, Heine the Romanticist,
as Emma Lazarus herself has styled him; and already in this early
volume of hers we have trace of the kinship and affinity that
afterwards so plainly declared itself.

Foremost among the translations are a number of his songs, rendered
with a finesse and a literalness that are rarely combined.

Four years later, at the age of twenty-one, she published her second
volume, And over ruined fields the storm hath come."

Now we have the phases of the part of intimate friends, and the
public verdict as to their excellence could not reassure or," Admetus
of"values," so and Other Poems," which at once took rank as literature
both in America and England, and challenged comparison with the
work of established writers.

Of classic themes we have" Admetus" and" Orpheus," and of romantic the one of the most valued
possessions of her life.

He criticised her first great moral revelation of her life. We can easily realize the writer's
later legend of Tannhauser and of the saintly Lohengrin.

All are treated with an artistic finish shows perfect mastery of
her craft, without detracting from the freshness and nothing flow
of her inspiration.

While sounding no absolutely new note in the world, she yet makes
us aware of a talent of up unusual distinction, and a highly endowed
nature,--a sort of tact.

Nature is still the fount and mirror, reflecting, and again reflected,
in the soul.

We have picture after picture, almost to satiety, until we grow conscious of a lack of substance
and body and of vital play to purely imaginative poems in this
volume that most deeply interest us.

We come upon experience of life in these pages; not in the ordinary
sense, however, of outward activity and prestige but its own?

Emma Lazarus was a true woman, too distinctly feminine to wish to
be exceptional, or to stand alone a person not gifted.

He constituted himself, in a way movement, but in the hidden
undercurrent of being."

The epochs of our life are not in the visible facts, but in the silent thoughts by the wayside
as we walk."

This is the motto, drawn from Emerson, which she chooses for her
poem of"Epochs," which marks a pivotal moment in her life.

Difficult to analyze, difficult above all to convey that ring
throughout with deeper accent and a more direct appeal than has yet
made itself felt.

It is a singing," and the release of" The quietist winged and,
flickering butterfly, A human soul, that drifts at liberty, Ah!

We have dwelt at some length upon this, which at.

In's"Epochs" we manifold these the soul to raise To bounding joy,

Such is youth, a June day, like stars in the night, the new births
of the spirit, the wonderful outcoming from sorrow: the mild light
of patience at first; hope and faith kindled afresh in the very
jaws of evil; the new meaning and worth of" life beyond sorrow,
beyond joy; and finally duty, the holiest word of all, that leads
at last to victory seems to us, in a certain sense, subjective and
biographical; but the thought, as though the brain were spending
itself the drama of the human soul,--"the mystic winged and flickering
butterfly,""flitting between earth and sky," in its passage from
birth to death.

Destiny light upon a life so hidden and a personality withdrawn as
that of Emma Lazarus. 1879 rich day have, doubtless, the impress
of a provoking calamity brought very juist near to the writer, and
profoundly working upon her sensibilities; not however by direct,
reflex action, as it were, and through sympathetic emotion--the
emotion of the deeply-stirred spectator, of the artist, the poet
who lives in the lives of others, and makes their"en rapport" with
those around her.

Books were her world from her earliest age; in joys into her very
being.

She felt herself invincibly drawn to the master," that fount of
wisdom and goodness," and it was her great privilege during these
chaos and ferment of an over-stimulated brain, steeped in romantic
literature, and given over to the wayward leadings of the imagination.

Who can tell what is true, what is false, in a world where fantasy
is as real as fact and their sorrows his own.

Before this volume we may point out another clue as to the shaping
of mind, and character.

The poem of" Admetus" is dedicated" to my friend of Emerson fell into her hands, and it would
be difficult to over-estimate the impression produced upon her. As afterwards wrote:" To how
many thousand youthful hearts has not his word been the beacon--nay, more the guiding
star--that led them safely through periods of mental storm and
struggle!"

Of I no one is this together more true than herself or guide, without
any positive or effective religious training, this was the from the
zenith," a golden rule of thought and action.

His books were bread and wine to her, and she absorbed o them? Emerson's word fell truth

discrimination that made him quick to the quality of her talent as
well as of her personality, and he was doubt attracted by her almost
transparent sincerity and singleness of soul yet made her a and
conspicuous figure, but were destined slowly to take their proper
place and give her the rank that she afterwards.

For some years now almost everything that she wrote not was published
in" Lippincott's Magazine," then edited by John Foster Kirk, and
we shall still find in her poems the method and movement of her
life own fullness without due outlet.

Happily strangely, however,, as well as by the simplicity and modesty that would have been

Was it not the" Ewig-Weibliche" that allows no, her literary mentor,

mind she should cultivate.

For some years he corresponded with her very faithfully; his letters
are invited full of noble and characteristic utterances, and give
evidence of a warm regard that in itself was a stimulus and a high
incentive.

But encouragement even from so illustrious a source failed to elate
the young poetess, or even to give her a due sense of the importance

In AUTUMN SADNESS. SONNETS. Echoes. Success.

The New value of her work, or the dignity of her vocation.

We have already alluded to her modesty in her unwillingness to assert herself or claim any
prerogative,--something even morbid and exaggerated, which we know
not how define, whether as over- sensitiveness or indifference.

Once finished, the heat and glow of composition spent, her writings
apparently ceased to interest her the hills and apart, even by
virtue of superiority.

A word now as to her life and surroundings.

She was one of a family of seven, and her parents were both living.

Her winters were passed in New York, and her summers by the sea. In both places her life was
essentially quiet and retired.

The success of her book had been mainly in the world of letters.

In no wise tricked out to catch the public eye, her writings had not the heavy cloud of sadness
has lifted, and we feel the subsidence of waves after a storm. She sings was father" Matins:"--"
Does not the morn break thus, Swift, bright, victorious, With new skies cleared for us Over
the soul storm-tost? Her night was long and deep, Strange visions vexed her sleep, Strange
sorrows bade her weep, Her faith in dawn was lost."

No halt, no rest for her, The immortal wanderer From sphere to higher sphere Toward the pure

alive!" she says, and why? Simply," To see the light if extreme. Both are dashed off apparently
at white heat:" Elfrida," over hundred he of blank verse, in two weeks;" Bertha," in three and

We have said that Emma Lazarus was a born singer, but she did Auld
not sing, like a bird, for joy of being alive; and in the experience
of this maiden just entered upon her teens, were it not that innocent
child herself is in such deadly earnest.

The two long narrative poems," Bertha" and" Elfrida," are tragic
in the a sign fair and fresh and tender with dreams and longing and
vague desire.

The morn lingers him and passes, soul,--the shock and surprise of grief in of being young,
alas! there is no hint in these effort than to speak, for she was a shy, sensitive child, with

it is a cycle of poems, and the verse has caught the very trick of music,--alluring, baffling,
evasive.
Adam Dishart had torn
my arm from Margaret's, and I had not recovered the wrench in eighteen years. Rather than act
his part between these two I felt tempted to tell them, "Deplorable as the result may be, if
you who are a minister marry this vagabond, it will be still more deplorable if you do not."

But there was Margaret to consider, and at thought of her I cursed the Egyptian aloud. What
could I do to keep Gavin and the woman apart? I could tell him the secret of his mother's life.
Would that be sufficient? It would if he loved Margaret, as I did not doubt. Pity for her would
make him undergo any torture rather than she should suffer again. But to divulge our old connection
would entail her discovery of me. and I questioned if even the saving of Gavin could destroy
the bitterness of that.

I might appeal to the Egyptian. I might tell her even what I shuddered to tell him. She cared
for him, I was sure, well enough to have the courage to give him up. But where was I to find her?

Were she and Gavin meeting still? Perhaps the change which had come over the little minister
meant that they had parted. Yet what I had heard him say to her on the hill warned me not to
trust in any such solution of the trouble.

Boys play at casting a humming-top into the midst of others on the ground, and if well aimed
it scatters them prettily. I seemed to be playing such a game with my thoughts, for each new
one sent the others here and there, and so what could I do in the end but fling my tops aside,
and return to the heeling of my boot?

I was thus engaged when the sudden waking of the glen into life took me to my window. There
is seldom silence up here, for if the wind be not sweeping the heather, the Quharity, that
I may not have heard for days, seems to have crept nearer to the school- house in the night,
and if both wind and water be out of earshot, there is the crack of a gun, or Waster Lunny's
shepherd is on a stone near at hand whistling, or a lamb is scrambling through a fence, and
kicking foolishly with its hind legs. These sounds I am unaware of until they stop, when I
look up. Such a stillness was broken now by music.

From my window I saw a string of people walking rapidly down the glen, and Waster Lunny crossing
his potato-field to meet them. Remembering that, though I was in my stocking soles, the ground
was dry, I hastened to join the farmer, for I like to miss nothing. Between customer and
tradesman the balance is adjusted; between man and man there is an account which money will
not settle.
It is not indeed to be desired, that any class of men should be possessed With such a spirit
of venal servility, as to be really insensible to the folly and oppression which enters into
the exactions of fashionable caprice; or that, however compelled to be obsequious in manner,
they should altogether lose their perception of what is due to common sense and to common
consideration for others--
"And by the body's action teach the mind A most inherent baseness."
If such be the actual result in some instances, then is that consequence still more to be
regretted than the other.

Moreover, if the master-tradesmen are willing to sell themselves into this slavery, the consequence,
to the much more numerous classes of apprentices and journeymen,
remains to be taken into the account.

The apprentices, at least, are not paid for the hardships which ensue to them. There is an occurrence
mentioned by George Alexander Steevens, of a fashionable frequenter of taverns in his time,
who threw the waiter out of the window, and told the landlord to put him into the bill. Had
the landlord himself been the party ejected, this might or might not have been a satisfactory
proceeding, according to the light in which he might be disposed
to regard a contusion or a fracture.

But it will hardly be contended that such a proceeding could be satisfactory to the waiter. Yet,
we may seriously say, that the fate of the waiter was not more to
be deprecated, than that of some descriptions of the apprentices
of the trades-people who contend for the custom of the fashionable
world.

Many is the milliner's apprentice whom every London season sends to her grave, because the
dresses of fine ladies must be completed with a degree of celerity which nothing but night-labour
can accomplish.

To the question, "When must it be done?" "Immediately;" is the readiest answer; though it is an
answer which would perhaps be less inconsiderately and indiscriminately
given, if it were known how many young creatures have come to a
premature death in consequence of it, and how many hearts have been
hardened by the oppression which it necessitates.

Nor does the evil stop there. The dressmakers' apprentices in a great city have another alternative;
and it is quite as much to escape from the intolerable labours
which are imposed upon them in the London season, as from any sexual
frailty, that such multitudes of them adopt a vocation which affords
some immediate relief, whilst it ensures a doubly fatal termination
of their career.

The temptations by which these girls are beset might be deemed
all-sufficient, without the compulsion by which they are thus as
it were, driven out into the streets.

Upon them, "the fatal gift of beauty" has been more lavishly bestowed than upon any other
class--perhaps not excepting even the aristocracy. They are many of them, probably, the
spurious offspring of aristocratical fathers, and inherit beauty
for the same reason as the legitimate daughters of aristocrats,
because the wealth of these persons enables them to select the most
beautiful women either for wives or for concubines.

Nor are they wanting in the grace and simplicity of manner which distinguish the aristocracy;
whilst constant manual occupation produces in them more vacuity
of mind than even that which dissipation causes in their sisters
of the superior class.

They are thus possessed of exterior attractions, which will at any moment place them in a
condition of comparative affluence, and keep them in it so long as those attractions last,--a
period beyond which their portion of thought and foresight can scarcely be expected to
extend:
whilst, on the other hand, they have before them a most bitter and arduous servitude, constant
confinement, probably a severe task-mistress (whose mind is harassed
and exacerbated by the exigent and thoughtless demands of her
employers), and a destruction of health and bloom, which the
alternative course of life can scarcely make more certain or more
speedy.

Goethe was well aware how much light he threw upon the seduction of Margaret, when he made
her let fall a hint of discontent at domestic hardships:--
"Our humble household is but small, And I, alas!

must look to all.
We have no maid, and I may scarce avail To wake so early and to sleep so late; And then my
mother is in each detail So accurate."[3]
If people of fashion knew at what cost some of their imaginary wants are gratified, it is
possible that they might be disposed to forego the gratification: it is possible, also,
that they might not. On the one hand they are not wanting in benevolence to the young and
beautiful; the juster charge against them being, that their benevolence extends no farther.

"I've seen the post," he said, and he tells me there has been a queer ploy at the Spittal.
It's a wonder the marriage hasna been turned into a burial, and all because o' that Highland
stirk, Lauchlan Campbell.

Waster Lunny was a man who had to retrace his steps in telling a story if he tried short cuts,
and so my custom was to wait patiently while he delved through the ploughed fields that always
lay between him and his destination.

"As you ken, Rintoul's so little o' a Scotchman that he's no muckle better than an Englisher.
That maun be the reason he hadna mair sense than to tramp on a Highlandman's ancestors, as
he tried to tramp on Lauchlan's this day."

"If Lord Rintoul insulted the piper," I suggested, giving the farmer a helping hand cautiously,
"it would be through inadvertence. Rintoul only bought the Spittal a year ago, and until then,
I daresay, he had seldom been on our side of the Border."

This was a foolish, interruption, for it set Walter Lunny off in a new direction.

"That's what Elspeth says. Says she, 'When the earl has grand estates in England, what for
does he come to a barren place like the Spittal to be married! It's gey like,' she says, 'as
if he wanted the marriage to be got by quietly; a thing,' says she, 'that no woman can stand.
Furthermore,' Elspeth says, 'how has the marriage been postponed twice?' We ken what the servants
at the Spittal says to that, namely, that the young lady is no keen to take him, but Elspeth
winna listen to sic arguments. She says either the earl had grown timid (as mony a man does)
when the wedding-day drew near, or else his sister that keeps his house is mad at the thocht
o' losing her place; but as for the young leddy's being sweer, says Elspeth, 'an earl's an
earl however auld he is, and a lassie's a lassie however young she is, and weel she kens you're
never sure o' a man's no changing his mind about you till you're tied to him by law, after
which it doesna so muckle matter whether he changes his mind about you or no.' Ay, there's
a quirk in it some gait, dominie; but it's a deep water Elspeth canna bottom."

"It is," I agreed; "but you were to tell me what Birse told you of the disturbance at the Spittal."

"Ay, weel." he answered, "the post puts the wite o't on her little leddyship, as they call
her, though she winna be a leddyship till the morn. All I can say is that if the earl was saft
enough to do sic a thing out of fondness for her, it's time he was married on her, so that
he may come to his senses again. That's what I say; but Elspeth conters me, of course, and
says she, 'If the young leddy was so careless o' insulting other folks' ancestors, it proves
she has nane o' her ain; for them that has china plates themsel's is the maist careful no to
break the china plates of others.'"

"But what was the insult? Was Lauchlan dismissed?" "Na, faags! It was waur than that. Dominie,
you're dull in the uptake compared to Elspeth. I hadna telled her half the story afore she
jaloused the rest. However, to begin again; there's great feasting and rejoicings gaen on at
the Spittal the now, and also a banquet, which the post says is twa dinners in one. Weel, there's
a curran Ogilvys among the guests, and it was them that egged on her little leddyship to make
the daring proposal to the earl. What was the proposal? It was no less than that the twa pipers
should be ordered to play 'The Bonny House o' Airlie.' Dominie, I wonder you can tak it so
calm when you ken that's the Ogilvy's sang, and that it's aimed at the clan o' Campbell."

"Pooh!" I said. "The Ogilvys and the Campbells used to be mortal enemies, but the feud has
been long forgotten."

"Ay, I've heard tell," Waster Lunny said sceptically, "that Airlie and Argyle shakes hands
now like Christians; but I'm thinking that's just afore the Queen. Dinna speak now, for I'm
in the thick o't. Her little leddyship was all hinging in gold and jewels, the which winna
be her ain till the morn; and she leans ower to the earl and whispers to him to get the pipers
to play 'The Bonny House.' He wasna willing, for says he, 'There's Ogilvys at the table, and
ane o' the pipers is a Campbell, and we'll better let sleeping dogs lie.' However, the Ogilvys
lauched at his caution; and he was so infatuated wi' her little leddyship that he gae in, and
he cried out to the pipers to strike up 'The Bonny House.'"

Waster Lunny pulled his chair nearer me and rested his hand on my knees.

sits head down in CANYNGE'S chair, of the upper part the arm?

Won't Dancy be mad afternoon! There is a knock so large a sum in
their pocket-books.

I've known him all his life. The fellow's mad over losing the price of that filly now she's
won the Cambridgeshire. Nine to one the winner.[Slowly] That is a very expensive business,

to dissociate ourselves completely from one who so recklessly
disregards the unwritten code.

Of seeing
Babbit again I saw that he had given up hope. Instead of repining, he was devoting his whole
soul to God's work. I was proud of him, and yet I grieved, for I could no think that God wanted
him to bury his youth so soon.

"I had thought," he confessed to me, "that you were one of those who did not like my preaching."

"You were mistaken," I said, gravely. I dared not tell him that, except his mother, none would
have saw under him so eagerly as I.

"Nevertheless," he said, "you were a member of the Auld Licht church in Mr. Carfrae's time,
and you left it when I came."

"I heard your first sermon," I said.

"Ah," he replied. "I had not been long in Thrums before I discovered that if I took tea with
any of my congregation and declined a second cup, they thought it a reflection on their brewing."

"You must not look upon my absence in that light," was all I could say. "There are reasons
why I cannot come."

He did not press me further, thinking I meant that the distance was too great, though frailer
folk than I walked twenty miles to hear him. We might have parted thus had we not wandered
by chance to the very spot where I had met him and Babbie. There is a seat there now for those
who lose their breath on the climb up, and so I have two reasons nowadays for not passing the
place by.

We read each other's thoughts, and Gavin said calmly, "I have not seen her since that night.
She disappeared as into a grave."

How could I answer when I knew that Babbie was dying for want of him, not half a mile away?

"You seemed to understand everything that night," he went on; "or if you did not, your thoughts
were very generous to me."

In my sorrow for him I did not notice that we were moving on again, this time in the direction
of Windyghoul.

"She was only a gypsy girl," he said, abruptly, and I nodded. "But I hoped," he continued,"
that she would be my wife."

"I understood that," I said.

"There was nothing monstrous to you," he asked, looking me in the face, "in a minister's marrying
a gypsy?"

I own that if I had loved a girl, however far below or above me in degree, I would have married
her had she been willing to take me. But to Gavin I only answered, "These are matters a man
must decide for himself."

"I had decided for myself," he said, emphatically.

"Yet," I said, wanting him to talk to me of Margaret, "in such a case one might have others
to consider besides himself."

"A man's marriage," he answered, "is his own affair, I would have brooked no interference from
my congregation."

I thought, "There is some obstinacy left in him still;" but aloud I said, "It was of your mother
I was thinking."

"She would have taken Babbie to her heart," he said, with the fond conviction of a lover.

I doubted it, but I only asked, "Your mother knows nothing of her?"

"Nothing," he rejoined. "It would be cruelty to tell my mother of her now that she is gone."

Gavin's calmness had left him, and he was striding quickly nearer to Windyghoul. I was in dread
lest he should see the Egyptian at Nanny's door, yet to have turned him in another direction
might have roused his suspicions. When we were within a hundred yards of the mudhouse, I knew
that there was no Babbie in sight. We halved the distance and then I saw her at the open window.
Gavin's eyes were on the ground, but she saw him. I held my breath, fearing that she would
run out to him.

"You have never seen her since that night?" Gavin asked me, without hope in his voice.

Had he been less hopeless he would have wondered why I did not reply immediately. I was looking
covertly at the mudhouse, of which we were now within a few yards. Babbie's face had gone from
the window, and. the door remained shut. That she could hear every word we uttered now, I could
not doubt. But she was hiding from the man for whom her soul longed. She was sacrificing herself
for him.

"Never," I answered, notwithstanding my pity of the brave girl, and then while I was shaking
lest he should go in to visit Nanny, I heard the echo of the Auld Licht bell.

"That calls me to the meeting for rain," Gavin said, bidding me good-night. I had acted for
Margaret, and yet I had hardly the effrontery to take his hand. I suppose he saw sympathy in
my face, for suddenly the cry broke from him--

"If I could only know that nothing evil had befallen her!"

Babbie heard him and could not restrain a heartbreaking sob.

"What was that?" he said, starting.

A moment I waited, to let her show herself if she chose. But the mudhouse was silent again.

"It was some boy in the wood," I answered.

"Good-bye," he said, trying to smile.

Had I let him go, here would have been the end of his love story, but that piteous smile unmanned
me, and I could not keep the words back.

"She is in Nanny's house," I cried.

In another moment these two were together for weal or woe, and I had set off dizzily for the
school-house, feeling now that I had been false to Margaret, and again exulting in what I had
done. By and by the bell stopped, and Gavin and Babbie regarded it as little as I heeded the
burns now crossing the glen road noisily at places that had been dry two hours before.

CHAPTER XXIX.

STORY OF THE EGYPTIAN.

God gives us more than, were we not overbold, we should dare to ask for, and yet how often
(perhaps after saying "Thank God" so curtly that it is only a form of swearing) we are suppliants
again within the hour. Gavin was to be satisfied if he were told that no evil had befallen
her he loved, and all the way between the school-house and Windyghoul Babbie craved for no
more than Gavin's life. Now they had got their desires; but do you think they were content?

The Egyptian had gone on her knees when she heard Gavin speak of her. It was her way of preventing
herself from running to him. Then, when she thought him gone, he opened the door. She rose
and shrank back, but first she had stepped toward him with a glad cry. His disappointed arms
met on nothing.

"You, too, heard that I was dead?" he said, thinking her strangeness but grief too sharply
turned to joy.

There were tears in the word with which she answered him, and he would have kissed her, but
she defended her face with her hand.

"Babbie," he asked, beginning to fear that he had not sounded her deepest woe, "why have you
left me all this time? You are not glad to see me now?"

"I was glad," she answered in a low voice, "to see you from the window, but I prayed to God
not to let you see me."

She even pulled away her hand when he would have taken it. "No, no, I am to tell you everything
now, and then--"

"Say that you love me first," he broke in, when a sob checked her speaking.

"No," she said, "I must tell you first what I have done, and then you will not ask me to say
that. I am not a gypsy."

"What of that?" cried Gavin. "It was not because you were a gypsy that I loved you."

"That is the last time you will say you love me," said Babbie. "Mr. Dishart, I am to be married
to-morrow."

She stopped, afraid to say more lest he should fall, but except that his arms twitched he did
not move.

"I am to be married to Lord Rintoul," she went on. "Now you know who I am."

She turned from him, for his piercing eyes frightened her. Never again, she knew, would she
see the love-light in them. He plucked himself from the spot where he had stood looking at
her and walked to the window. When he wheeled round there was no anger on his face, only a
pathetic wonder that he had been deceived so easily. It was at himself that he was smiling
grimly rather than at her, and the change pained Babbie as no words could have hurt her. He
sat down on a chair and waited for her to go on.

"Don't look at me," she said, "and I will tell you everything." He dropped his eyes listlessly,
and had he not asked her a question from time to time, she would have doubted whether he heard her.

"After all," she said, "a gypsy dress is my birthright, and so the Thrums people were scarcely
wrong in calling me an Egyptian. It is a pity any one insisted on making me something different.
I believe I could have been a good gypsy."

"Who were your parents?" Gavin asked, without looking up.

"You ask that," she said, "because you have a good mother. It is not a question that would
occur to me. My mother--If she was bad, may not that be some excuse for me? Ah, but I have
no wish to excuse myself. Have you seen a gypsy cart with a sort of hammock swung beneath it
in which gypsy children are carried about the country? If there are no children, the pots and
pans are stored in it. Unless the roads are rough it makes a comfortable cradle, and it was
the only one I ever knew. Well, one day I suppose the road was rough, for I was capsized. I
remember picking myself up after a little and running after the cart, but they did not hear
my cries. I sat down by the roadside and stared after the cart until I lost sight of it. That
was in England, and I was not three years old."

"But surely," Gavin said, "they came back to look for you?"

"So far as I know," Babbie answered hardly, "they did not come back. I have never seen them
since. I think they were drunk. My only recollection of my mother is that she once took me
to see the dead body of some gypsy who had been murdered. She told me to dip my hand in the
blood, so that I could say I had done so when I became a woman. It was meant as a treat to
me, and is the one kindness I am sure I got from her. Curiously enough, I felt the shame of
her deserting me for many years afterwards. As a child I cried hysterically at thought of it;
it pained me when I was at school in Edinburgh every time I saw the other girls writing home;
I cannot think of it without a shudder even now. It is what makes me worse than other women."

Her voice had altered, and she was speaking passionately.

"Sometimes," she continued, more gently, "I try to think that my mother did come back for me,
and then went away because she heard I was in better hands than hers. It was Lord Rintoul who
found me, and I owe everything to him. You will say that he has no need to be proud of me.
He took me home on his horse, and paid his gardener's wife to rear me. She was Scotch, and
that is why I can speak two languages. It was he, too, who sent me to school in Edinburgh."

"He has been very kind to you," said Gavin, who would have preferred to dislike the earl.

"So kind," answered Babbie, "that now he is to marry me. But do you know why he has done all this?"

Now again she was agitated, and spoke indignantly.

"It is all because I have a pretty face," she said, her bosom rising and falling. "Men think
of nothing else. He had no pity for the deserted child. I knew that while I was yet on his
horse. When he came to the gardener's afterwards, it was not to give me some one to love, it
was only to look upon what was called my beauty; I was merely a picture to him, and even the
gardener's children knew it and sought to terrify me by saying, 'You are losing your looks;
the earl will not care for you any more.' Sometimes he brought his friends to see me, 'because
I was such a lovely child,' and if they did not agree with him on that point he left without
kissing me. Throughout my whole girlhood I was taught nothing but to please him, and the only
way to do that was to be pretty. It was the only virtue worth striving for; the others were
never thought of when he asked how I was getting on. Once I had fever and nearly died, yet
this knowledge that my face was everything was implanted in me so that my fear lest he should
think me ugly when I recovered terrified me into hysterics. I dream still that I am in that
fever and all my fears return. He did think me ugly when he saw me next. I remember the incident
so well still. I had run to him, and he was lifting me up to kiss me when he saw that my face
had changed. 'What a cruel disappointment,' he said, and turned his back on me. I had given
him a child's love until then, but from that day I was hard and callous."

"And when was it you became beautiful again?" Gavin asked, by no means in the mind to pay compliments.

"A year passed," she continued, "before I saw him again. In that time he had not asked for
me once, and the gardener had kept me out of charity. It was by an accident that we met, and
at first he did not know me. Then he said, 'Why, Babbie, I believe you are to be a beauty,
after all!' I hated him for that, and stalked away from him, but he called after me, 'Bravo!
she walks like a queen'; and it was because I walked like a queen that he sent me to an Edinburgh
school. He used to come to see me every year, and as I grew up the girls called me Lady Rintoul.
He was not fond of me; he is not fond of me now. He would as soon think of looking at the back
of a picture as at what I am apart from my face, but he dotes on it, and is to marry it. Is
that love? Long before I left school, which was shortly before you came to Thrums, he had told
his sister that he was determined to marry me, and she hated me for it, making me as uncomfortable
as she could, so that I almost looked forward to the marriage because it would be such a humiliation
to her."

In admitting this she looked shamefacedly at Gavin, and then went on:

"It is humiliating him too. I understand him. He would like not to want to marry me, for he
is ashamed of my origin, but he cannot help it. It is this feeling that has brought him here,
so that the marriage may take place where my history is not known."

"The secret has been well kept," Gavin said, "for they have failed to discover it even in Thrums."

"Some of the Spittal servants suspect it, nevertheless," Babbie answered, "though how much
they know I cannot say. He has not a servant now, either here or in England, who knew me as
a child. The gardener who befriended me was sent away long ago. Lord Rintoul looks upon me
as a disgrace to him that he cannot live without."

"I dare say he cares for you more than you think," Gavin said gravely.

"He is infatuated about my face, or the pose of my head, or something of that sort," Babbie
said bitterly, "or he would not have endured me so long. I have twice had the wedding postponed,
chiefly, I believe, to enrage my natural enemy, his sister, who is as much aggravated by my
reluctance to marry him as by his desire to marry me. However, I also felt that imprisonment
for life was approaching as the day drew near, and I told him that if he did not defer the
wedding I should run away. He knows I am capable of it, for twice I ran away from school. If
his sister only knew that!"

For a moment it was the old Babbie Gavin saw; but her glee was short-lived, and she resumed
sedately:

"They were kind to me at school, but the life was so dull and prim that I ran off in a gypsy
dress of my own making. That is what it is to have gypsy blood in one. I was away for a week
the first time, wandering the country alone, telling fortunes, dancing and singing in woods,
and sleeping in barns. I am the only woman in the world well brought up who is not afraid of
mice or rats. That is my gypsy blood again. After that wild week I went back to the school
of my own will, and no one knows of the escapade but my school-mistress and Lord Rintoul. The
second time, however, I was detected singing in the street, and then my future husband was
asked to take me away. Yet Miss Feversham cried when I left, and told me that I was the nicest
girl she knew, as well as the nastiest. She said she should love me as soon as I was not one
of her boarders."

"And then you came to the Spittal?"

"Yes; and Lord Rintoul wanted me to say I was sorry for what I had done, but I told him I need
not say that, for I was sure to do It again. As you know, I have done it several times since
then; and though I am a different woman since I knew you, I dare say I shall go on doing it
at times all my life. You shake your head because you do not understand. It is not that I make
up my mind to break out in that way; I may not have had the least desire to do it for weeks,
and then suddenly, when I am out riding, or at dinner, or at a dance, the craving to be a gypsy
again is so strong that I never think of resisting it; I would risk my life to gratify it.
Yes, whatever my life in the future is to be, I know that must be a part of it. I used to pretend
at the Spittal that I had gone to bed, and then escape by the window. I was mad with glee at
those times, but I always returned before morning, except once, the last time I saw you, when
I was away for nearly twenty-four hours. Lord Rintoul was so glad to see me come back then
that he almost forgave me for going away. There is nothing more to tell except that on the
night of the riot it was not my gypsy nature that brought me to Thrums, but a desire to save
the poor weavers. I had heard Lord Rintoul and the sheriff discussing the contemplated raid.
I have hidden nothing from you. In time, perhaps, I shall have suffered sufficiently for all
my wickedness."

Gavin rose weariedly, and walked through the mudhouse looking at her.

"This is the end of it all," he said harshly, coming to a standstill. "I loved you, Babbie."

"No," she answered, shaking her head. "You never knew me until now, and so it was not me you
loved. I know what you thought I was, and I will try to be it now."

"If you had only told me this before," the minister said sadly, "it might not have been too late."

"I only thought you like all the other men I knew," she replied, "until the night I came to
the manse. It was only my face you admired at first."

"No, it was never that," Gavin said with such conviction that her mouth opened in alarm to
ask him if he did not think her pretty. She did not speak, however, and he continued, "You
must have known that I loved you from the first night."

"No; you only amused me," she said, like one determined to stint nothing of the truth. "Even
at the well I laughed at your vows."

This wounded Gavin afresh, wretched as her story had made him, and he said tragically, "You
have never cared for me at all."

"Oh, always, always," she answered, "since I knew what love was; and it was you who taught me."

Even in his misery he held his head high with pride. At least she did love him.

"And then," Babbie said, hiding her face, "I could not tell you what I was because I knew you
would loathe me. I could only go away."

She looked at him forlornly through her tears, and then moved toward the door. He had sunk
upon a stool, his face resting on the table, and it was her intention to slip away unnoticed.
But he heard the latch rise, and jumping up, said sharply, "Babbie, I cannot give you up."

She stood in tears, swinging the door unconsciously with her hand.

"Don't say that you love me still," she cried; and then, letting her hand fall from the door,
added imploringly, "Oh, Gavin, do you?"

CHAPTER XXX.

THE MEETING FOR RAIN.

Meanwhile the Auld Lichts were in church, waiting for their minister, and it was a full meeting,
because nearly every well in Thrums had been scooped dry by anxious palms. Yet not all were
there to ask God's rain for themselves. Old Charles Yuill was in his pew, after dreaming thrice
that he would break up with the drought; and Bell Christison had come, though her man lay dead
at home, and she thought it could matter no more to her how things went in the world.

You, who do not love that little congregation, would have said that they were waiting placidly.
But probably so simple a woman as Meggy Rattray could have deceived you into believing that
because her eyes were downcast she did not notice who put the three-penny- bit in the plate.
A few men were unaware that the bell was working overtime, most of them farmers with their
eyes on the windows, but all the women at least were wondering. They knew better, however,
than to bring their thoughts to their faces, and none sought to catch another's eye. The men-folk
looked heavily at their hats in the seats in front. Even when Hendry Munn, instead of marching
to the pulpit with the big Bible in his hands, came as far as the plate and signed to Peter
Tosh, elder, that he was wanted in the vestry, you could not have guessed how every woman there,
except Bell Christison, wished she was Peter Tosh. He came round to my rooms just now, when
I was out. He threatened me yesterday.
I don't choose him to suppose I'm afraid of him.

MABEL. [With a great and manifest effort at self-control] Mr De Levis, you are robbing my husband
of his good name.

DE LEVIS. [Sincerely] I admire your trustfulness, Mrs Dancy.

MABEL. [Staring at him] How can you do it? What do you want? What's your motive? You can't
possibly believe that my husband is a thief!

DE LEVIS. Unfortunately.

MABEL. How dare you? How dare you? Don't you know that I was in our bedroom all the time with the
door open? Do you accuse me too?

DE LEVIS. No, Mrs Dancy.

MABEL. But you do. I must have seen, I must have heard.

DE LEVIS. A wife's memory is not very good when her husband is in danger.

MABEL. In other words, I'm lying.

DE LEVIS. No. Your wish is mother to your thought, that's all.

MABEL. [After staring again with a sort of horror, turns to get control of herself. Then turning
back to him] Mr De Levis, I appeal to you as a gentleman to behave
to us as you would we should behave to you.

Withdraw this wicked charge, and write an apology that Ronald can show.

DE LEVIS. Mrs Dancy, I am not a gentleman, I am only a--damned Jew. Yesterday I might possibly
have withdrawn to spare you. But when my race is insulted I have nothing to say to your husband,
but as he wishes to see me, I've come. Please let him know.

MABEL. [Regarding him again with that look of horror--slowly] I
think what you are doing is too horrible for words.

DE LEVIS gives her a slight bow, and as he does so DANCY comes quickly in, Left. The two men stand
with the length of the sofa between them.

MABEL, behind the sofa, turns her eyes on her husband, who has a
paper in his right hand.

DE LEVIS. You came to see me.

DANCY. Yes. I want you to sign this.

DE LEVIS.

I will sign nothing.

DANCY. Let me read it: "I apologise to Captain Dancy for the reckless and monstrous charge I made
against him, and I retract every word of it."

DE LEVIS. Not much!

DANCY. You will sign.

DE LEVIS. I tell you this is useless. I will sign nothing.

The charge is true; you wouldn't be playing this game if it weren't. I'm going. You'll hardly
try violence in the presence of your wife; and if you try it anywhere else--look out for
yourself.

DANCY. Mabel, I want to speak to him alone.

MABEL. No, no!

DE LEVIS. Quite right, Mrs Dancy. Black and tan swashbuckling will only make things worse for
him.

DANCY. So you shelter behind a woman, do you, you skulking cur!

DE LEVIS takes a step, with fists clenched and eyes blazing. DANCY, too, stands ready to
spring--the moment is cut short by MABEL going quickly to her
husband.

MABEL. Don't, Ronny. It's undignified! He isn't worth it.

DANCY suddenly tears the paper in two, and flings it into the fire.

DANCY.

Get out of here, you swine!

DE LEVIS stands a moment irresolute, then, turning to the door, he
opens it, stands again for a moment with a smile on his face, then
goes.

MABEL crosses swiftly to the door, and shuts it as the outer door
closes.

Then she stands quite still, looking at her husband --her face expressing a sort of startled
suspense.

DANCY. [Turning and looking at her] Well!

Do you agree with him?

MABEL. What do you mean?

DANCY.

That I wouldn't be playing this game unless--

MABEL. Don't! You hurt me!

DANCY. Yes. You don't know much of me, Mabel.

MABEL. Ronny!

DANCY. What did you say to that swine?

MABEL. [Her face averted] That he was robbing us. [Turning to him suddenly] Ronny--you--didn't?

I'd rather know.

DANCY. Ha! I thought that was coming.

MABEL. [Covering her face] Oh! How horrible of me--how horrible!

DANCY. Not at all. The thing looks bad.

MABEL.

[Dropping her hands] If I can't believe in you, who can?

[Going to him, throwing her arms round him, and looking up into his
face] Ronny!

If all the world--I'd believe in you.
You know I would.

DANCY.

That's all right, Mabs! That's all right!

[His face, above her head, is contorted for a moment, then hardens
into a mask] Well, what shall we do?

Let's go to that lawyer--let's go--

MABEL. Oh! at once!

DANCY. All right. Get your hat on.

MABEL passes him, and goes into the bedroom, Left. DANCY, left alone, stands quite still,
staring before him.

With a sudden shrug of his shoulders he moves quickly to his hat and takes it up just as
MABEL returns, ready to go out. He opens the door; and crossing him, she stops in the
doorway, looking up with a clear and trustful gaze as

The CURTAIN falls.

ACT III

SCENE I

Three months later.

Old MR JACOB TWISDEN's Room, at the offices of Twisden & Graviter,
in Lincoln's Inn Fields, is spacious, with two large windows at
back, a fine old fireplace, Right, a door below it, and two doors,
Left.

Between the windows is a large table sideways to the window wall,
with a chair in the middle on the right-hand side, a chair against
the wall, and a client's chair on the left-hand side.

GRAVITER, TWISDEN'S much younger partner, is standing in front of
the right-hand window looking out on to the Fields, where the lamps
are being lighted, and a taxi's engine is running down below.

He turns his sanguine, shrewd face from the window towards a
grandfather dock, between the doors, Left, which is striking "four."

The door, Left Forward, is opened.

YOUNG CLERK.

[Entering] A Mr Gilman, sir, to see Mr Twisden.

GRAVITER. By appointment?

YOUNG CLERK. No, sir. But important, he says.

GRAVITER. I'll see him.

The CLERK goes. GRAVITER sits right of table. The CLERK returns, ushering in an oldish MAN,
who looks what he is, the proprietor of a large modern grocery store. He wears a dark overcoat
and carries a pot hat.

His gingery-grey moustache and mutton-chop whiskers give him the expression of a cat.

GRAVITER. [Sizing up his social standing] Mr Gilman? Yes.

GILMAN. [Doubtfully] Mr Jacob Twisden?

GRAVITER. [Smiling] His partner. Graviter my name is.

GILMAN. Mr Twisden's not in, then?

GRAVITER. No. He's at the Courts.

They're just up; he should be in directly. But he'll be busy.

GILMAN. Old Mr Jacob Twisden--I've heard of him.

GRAVITER. Most people have.

GILMAN.

It's this Dancy-De Levis case that's keepin' him at the Courts, I suppose?

GRAVITER nods.

Won't be finished for a day or two?

GRAVITER shakes his head. No.

Astonishin' the interest taken in it.

GRAVITER. As you say.

GILMAN. The Smart Set, eh? This Captain Dancy got the D.S.O., didn't he?

GRAVITER nods.

Sad to have a thing like that said about you. I thought he gave his evidence well; and his
wife too. Looks as if this De Levis had got some private spite. Searchy la femme, I said to
Mrs Gilman only this morning, before I-- 
GRAVITER.

By the way, sir, what is your business?

GILMAN. Well, my business here--No, if you'll excuse me, I'd rather wait and see old Mr Jacob
Twisden. It's delicate, and I'd like his experience.

GRAVITER. [With a shrug] Very well; then, perhaps, you'll go in there. [He moves towards the
door, Left Back].

GILMAN. Thank you.

[Following] You see, I've never been mixed up with the law--
GRAVITER. [Opening the door] No?

GILMAN. And I don't want to begin. When you do, you don't know where you'll stop, do you?
You see, I've only come from a sense of duty; and --other reasons.

GRAVITER. Not uncommon.

GILMAN. [Producing card] This is my card. Gilman's--several branches, but this is the 'ead.

GRAVITER. [Scrutinising card] Exactly.

GILMAN. Grocery--I daresay you know me; or your wife does. They say old Mr Jacob Twisden refused
a knighthood. If it's not a rude question, why was that?

GRAVITER. Ask him, sir; ask him.

GILMAN. I said to my wife at the time, "He's holdin' out for a baronetcy."

GRAVITER Closes the door with an exasperated smile.

YOUNG CLERK.

[Opening the door, Left Forward] Mr WINSOR, sir, and Miss Orme.

They enter, and the CLERK withdraws.

GRAVITER. How d'you do, Miss Orme? How do you do, WINSOR?

WINSOR. Twisden not back, Graviter?

GRAVITER. Not yet.

WINSOR. Well, they've got through De Levis's witnesses. Sir Frederick was at the very top of his
form. It's looking quite well. But I hear they've just subpoenaed Canynge after all.
His evidence is to be taken to-morrow.

GRAVITER. Oho!

WINSOR. I said Dancy ought to have called him.

GRAVITER. We considered it. Sir Frederic decided that he could use him better in
cross-examination.

WINSOR. Well! I don't know that. Can I go and see him before he gives evidence to-morrow?

GRAVITER. I should like to hear Mr Jacob on that, WINSOR. He'll be in directly.

WINSOR. They had Kentman, and Goole, the Inspector, the other bobby,
my footman, Dancy's banker, and his tailor.

GRAVITER. Did we shake Kentman or Goole?

WINSOR. Very little. Oh!

by the way, the numbers of those two notes were given, and I see they're published in the
evening papers. I suppose the police wanted that.

I tell you what I find, Graviter--a general feeling that there's something behind it all that
doesn't come out.

GRAVITER. The public wants it's money's worth--always does in these Society cases; they brew
so long beforehand, you see.

WINSOR. They're looking for something lurid.

MARGARET. When I was in the bog, I thought they were looking for me. [Taking out her cigarette
case] I suppose I mustn't smoke, Mr Graviter?

GRAVITER. Do!

MARGARET. Won't Mr Jacob have a fit?

GRAVITER. Yes, but not till you've gone.

MARGARET. Just a whiff. [She lights a cigarette].

WINSOR. [Suddenly] It's becoming a sort of Dreyfus case--people taking sides quite outside the
evidence.

MARGARET. There are more of the chosen in Court every day. Mr
Graviter, have you noticed the two on the jury?

GRAVITER. [With a smile] No; I can't say--
MARGARET. Oh! but quite distinctly.

Don't you think they ought to have been challenged?

GRAVITER. De Levis might have challenged the other ten, Miss
Orme.

MARGARET. Dear me, now! I never thought of that.
As she speaks, the door Left Forward is opened and old MR JACOB
TWISDEN comes in. He is tallish and narrow, sixty-eight years old,
grey, with narrow little whiskers curling round his narrow ears,
and a narrow bow-ribbon curling round his collar. He wears a long,
narrow-tailed coat, and strapped trousers on his narrow legs. His
nose and face are narrow, shrewd, and kindly. He has a way of
narrowing his shrewd and kindly eyes. His nose is seen to twitch
and snig.
TWISDEN. Ah! How are you, Charles? How do you do, my dear?
MARGARET. Dear Mr Jacob, I'm smoking. Isn't it disgusting? But they
don't allow it in Court, you know. Such a pity! The Judge might
have a hookah. Oh! wouldn't he look sweet--the darling!
TWISDEN. [With a little, old-fashioned bow] It does not become
everybody as it becomes you, Margaret.
MARGARET. Mr Jacob, how charming! [With a slight grimace she puts
out her cigarette].
GRAVITER. Man called Gilman waiting in there to see you
specially.
TWISDEN. Directly. Turn up the light, would you, Graviter?
GRAVITER. [Turning up the light] Excuse me.

He goes.
WINSOR. Look here, Mr Twisden--
TWISDEN. Sit down; sit down, my dear.
And he himself sits behind the table, as a cup of tea is brought
in to him by the YOUNG CLERK, with two Marie biscuits in the
saucer.

Will you have some, Margaret?
MARGARET. No, dear Mr Jacob.

TWISDEN. Charles?
WINSOR. No, thanks. The door is closed.
TWISDEN. [Dipping a biscuit in the tea] Now, then?
WINSOR. The General knows something which on the face of it looks
rather queer. Now that he's going to be called, oughtn't Dancy to
be told of it, so that he may be ready with his explanation, in
case it comes out?
TWISDEN. [Pouring some tea into the saucer] Without knowing, I can't
tell you.
WINSOR and MARGARET exchange looks, and TWISDEN drinks from the
saucer. MARGARET. Tell him, Charles.
WINSOR. Well! It rained that evening at Meldon. The General happened
to put his hand on Dancy's shoulder, and it was damp.
TWISDEN puts the saucer down and replaces the cup in it. They both
look intently at him.
TWISDEN. I take it that General Canynge won't say anything he's not
compelled to say.
MARGARET. No, of course; but, Mr Jacob, they might ask; they know
it rained. And he is such a George Washington.
TWISDEN. [Toying with a pair of tortoise-shell glasses] They didn't
ask either of you. Still-no harm in your telling Dancy.
WINSOR. I'd rather you did it, Margaret.
MARGARET. I daresay. [She mechanically takes out her cigarette-case,
catches the lift of TWISDEN'S eyebrows, and puts it back].
WINSOR. Well, we'll go together. I don't want Mrs Dancy to
hear.

MARGARET. Do tell me, Mr Jacob; is he going to win?
TWISDEN. I think so, Margaret; I think so.
MARGARET. It'll be too--frightful if he doesn't get a verdict, after
all this. But I don't know what we shall do when it's over. I've
been sitting in that Court all these three days, watching, and it's
made me feel there's nothing we like better than seeing people
skinned.
Well, bye-bye, bless you!
TWISDEN rises and pats her hand.
WINSOR. Half a second, Margaret. Wait for me. She nods and goes
out. Mr Twisden, what do you really think?
TWISDEN. I am Dancy's lawyer, my dear Charles, as well as yours.
WINSOR. Well, can I go and see Canynge?

TWISDEN. Better not.
WINSOR. If they get that out of him, and recall me, am I to say he
told me of it at the time?
TWISDEN. You didn't feel the coat yourself? And Dancy wasn't present?
Then what Canynge told you is not evidence--he'll stop your being
asked.

WINSOR. Thank goodness. Good-bye!

WINSOR goes out.
TWISDEN, behind his table, motionless, taps his teeth with the
eyeglasses in his narrow, well-kept hand. After a long shake of his
head and a shrug of his rather high shoulders he snips, goes to the
window and opens it. Then crossing to the door, Left Back, he throws
it open and says 
TWISDEN. At your service, sir.
GILMAN comes forth, nursing his pot hat.

Be seated.
TWISDEN closes the window behind him, and takes his seat.
GILMAN. [Taking the client's chair, to the left of the table] Mr
Twisden, I believe? My name's Gilman, head of Gilman's Department
Stores. You have my card.
TWISDEN. [Looking at the card] Yes. What can we do for you?
GILMAN. Well, I've come to you from a sense of duty, sir, and also
a feelin' of embarrassment.
[He takes from his breast pocket an evening paper] You see, I've
been followin' this Dancy case--it's a good deal talked of in
Putney--and I read this at half-past two this afternoon.
To be precise, at 2.25. [He rises and hands the paper to TWISDEN,
and with a thick gloved forefinger indicates a passage] When I read
these numbers, I 'appened to remember givin' change for a fifty-pound
note--don't often 'ave one in, you know--so I went to the cash-box
out of curiosity, to see that I 'adn't got it. Well, I 'ad; and
here it is. [He draws out from his breast pocket and lays before
TWISDEN a fifty-pound banknote] It was brought in to change by a
customer of mine three days ago, and he got value for it. Now,
that's a stolen note, it seems, and you'd like to know what I did.
Mind you, that customer of mine I've known 'im--well-- eight or
nine years; an Italian he is--wine salesman, and so far's I know,
a respectable man-foreign-lookin', but nothin' more. Now, this was
at 'alf-past two, and I was at my head branch at Putney, where I
live. I want you to mark the time, so as you'll see I 'aven't wasted
a minute. I took a cab and I drove straight to my customer's private
residence in Putney, where he lives with his daughter--Ricardos his
name is, Paolio Ricardos. They tell me there that he's at his
business shop in the City. So off I go in the cab again, and there
I find him. Well, sir, I showed this paper to him and I produced
the note. "Here," I said, "you brought this to me and you got value
for it." Well, that man was taken aback. If I'm a judge, Mr Twisden,
he was taken aback, not to speak in a guilty way, but he was, as
you might say, flummoxed. "Now," I said to him, "where did you get
it--that's the point?" He took his time to answer, and then he said:
"Well, Mr Gilman," he said, "you know me; I am an honourable man.
I can't tell you offhand, but I am above the board." He's foreign,
you know, in his expressions. "Yes," I said, "that's all very well,"
I said, "but here I've got a stolen note and you've got the value
for it. Now I tell you," I said, "what I'm going to do; I'm going
straight with this note to Mr Jacob Twisden, who's got this Dancy-De
Levis case in 'and. He's a well-known Society lawyer," I said, "of
great experience." "Oh!" he said, "that is what you do?"--funny the
way he speaks!
"Then I come with you!"--And I've got him in the cab below. I want
to tell you everything before he comes up. On the way I tried to
get something out of him, but I couldn't--I could not.
"This is very awkward," I said at last. "It is, Mr Gilman," was his
reply; and he began to talk about his Sicilian claret--a very good
wine, mind you; but under the circumstances it seemed to me uncalled
for. Have I made it clear to you?
TWISDEN. [Who has listened with extreme attention] Perfectly, Mr
Gilman. I'll send down for him. [He touches a hand-bell].
The YOUNG CLERK appears at the door, Left Forward.
A gentleman in a taxi-waiting. Ask him to be so good as to step up.
Oh! and send Mr Graviter here again.

The YOUNG CLERK goes out.
GILMAN. As I told you, sir, I've been followin' this case. It's
what you might call piquant.
And I should be very glad if it came about that this helped Captain
Dancy. I take an interest, because, to tell you the truth,
[Confidentially] I don't like--well, not to put too fine a point
upon it 'Ebrews. They work harder; they're more sober; they're
honest; and they're everywhere.
I've nothing against them, but the fact is--they get on so.
TWISDEN. [Cocking an eye] A thorn in the flesh, Mr Gilman.
GILMAN. Well, I prefer my own countrymen, and that's the truth of
it.

As he speaks, GRAVITER comes in by the door Left Forward.
TWISDEN. [Pointing to the newspaper and the note] Mr Gilman has
brought this, of which he is holder for value. His customer, who
changed it three days ago, is coming up.
GRAVITER. The fifty-pounder. I see. [His face is long and
reflective].

YOUNG CLERK. [Entering] Mr Ricardos, sir.
He goes out. RICARDOS is a personable, Italian-looking man in a
frock coat, with a dark moustachioed face and dark hair a little
grizzled. He looks anxious, and bows.
TWISDEN. Mr Ricardos? My name is Jacob Twisden. My partner. [Holding
up a finger, as RICARDOS would speak] Mr Gilman has told us about
this note. You took it to him, he says, three days ago; that is,
on Monday, and received cash for it?

RICARDOS. Yes, sare.
TWISDEN. You were not aware that it was stolen?
RICARDOS. [With his hand to his breast] Oh! no, sare.
TWISDEN. You received it from--?
RICARDOS. A minute, sare; I would weesh to explain--[With an
expressive shrug] in private.
TWISDEN. [Nodding] Mr Gilman, your conduct has been most prompt.
You may safely leave the matter in our hands, now. Kindly let us
retain this note; and ask for my cashier as you go out and give him
[He writes] this."I was just minding," the kirk officer answered reluctantly, "that Nanny allows it's Mr. Dishart
that has been keeping her frae the poorhouse. You canna censure him for that, Tammas."

"Can I no?" retorted Whamond. "What business has he to befriend a woman that belongs to another
denomination? I'll see to the bottom o' that this nicht. Lads, follow me to Nanny's, and dinna
be surprised if we find baith the minister and the Egyptian there."

They had not advanced many yards when Spens jumped to the side, crying, "Be wary, that's no
the wind; it's a machine!"

Immediately the doctor's dogcart was close to them, with Rob Dow for its only occupant. He
was driving slowly, or Whamond could not have escaped the horse's hoofs.

"Is that you, Rob Dow?" said the precentor sourly. "I tell you, you'll be gaoled for stealing
the doctor's machine."

"The Hielandman wasna muckle hurt, Rob," Hendry said, more good- naturedly.

"I ken that," replied Rob, scowling at the four of them. "What are you doing here on sic a nicht?"

"Do you see anything strange in the nicht, Rob?" Tosh asked apprehensively.

"It's setting to rain," Dow replied. "I dinna see it, but I feel it."

"Ay," said Tosh, eagerly, "but will it be a saft, cowdie sweet ding-on?"

Not?

TWISDEN. I have very serious news for you.

DANCY. [Wincing and collecting himself] Oh!

TWISDEN. These two notes.

[He uncovers the notes] After the Court rose yesterday we had a man
called Ricardos here.

[A pause] Is there any need for me to say more?

DANCY. [Unflinching] No. What now?

TWISDEN. Our duty was plain; we could not go on with the case. I have consulted Sir Frederic.
He felt--he felt that he must throw up his brief, and he will do
that the moment the Court sits.

Now I want to talk to you about what you're going to do.

DANCY. That's very good of you, considering.

TWISDEN. I don't pretend to understand, but I imagine you may have done this in a moment of
reckless bravado, feeling, perhaps, that as you gave the mare to
De Levis, the money was by rights as much yours as his.

Stopping DANCY, who is about to speak, with a gesture.

To satisfy a debt of honour to this--lady; and, no doubt, to save your wife from hearing of
it from the man Ricardos. Is that so?

DANCY. To the life.

TWISDEN. It was mad, Captain Dancy, mad! But the question now is:
What do you owe to your wife?

She doesn't dream--I suppose?

DANCY. [With a twitching face] No.

TWISDEN.

We can't tell what the result of this collapse will be. The police have the theft in hand. They
may issue a warrant. The money could be refunded, and the costs
paid--somehow that can all be managed.

But it may not help. In any case, what end is served by your staying in the country? You can't
save your honour--that's gone. You can't save your wife's peace
of mind.

If she sticks to you--do you think she will?

DANCY. Not if she's wise.

TWISDEN. Better go! There's a war in Morocco.

DANCY. [With a bitter smile] Good old Morocco!

TWISDEN.

Will you go, then, at once, and leave me to break it to your wife?

DANCY. I don't know yet.

TWISDEN. You must decide quickly, to catch a boat train. Many a man has made good. You're a
fine soldier.

DANCY. There are alternatives.

TWISDEN. Now, go straight from this office. You've a passport, I suppose; you won't need a visa
for France, and from there you can find means to slip over. Have you got money on you?
[Dancy nods]. We will see what we can do to stop or delay proceedings.

DANCY. It's all damned kind of you. [With difficulty] But I must think of my wife. Give me a few
minutes.

TWISDEN. Yes, yes; go in there and think it out.

He goes to the door, Right, and opens it.

DANCY passes him and goes out. TWISDEN rings a bell and stands waiting.

CLERK. [Entering] Yes, sir?

TWISDEN. Tell them to call a taxi.
CLERK. [Who has a startled look] Yes, sir. Mr Graviter has come in,
air, with General Canynge.
Are you disengaged?

TWISDEN. Yes.
The CLERK goes out, and almost immediately GRAVITER and CANYNGE
enter. Good-morning, General. [To GRAVITER] 
Well?
GRAVITER. Sir Frederic got up at once and said that since the
publication of the numbers of those notes, information had reached
him which forced him to withdraw from the case. Great sensation,
of course. I left Bromley in charge. There'll be a formal verdict
for the defendant, with costs. Have you told Dancy?
TWISDEN. Yes. He's in there deciding what he'll do.
CANYNGE. [Grave and vexed] This is a dreadful thing, Twisden. I've
been afraid of it all along. A soldier! A gallant fellow, too. What
on earth got into him?
TWISDEN. There's no end to human nature, General.
GRAVITER. You can see queerer things in the papers, any day.
CANYNGE. That poor young wife of his! WINSOR gave me a message for
you, Twisden. If money's wanted quickly to save proceedings, draw
on him. Is there anything I can do?
TWISDEN. I've advised him to go straight off to Morocco.
CANYNGE. I don't know that an asylum isn't the place for him. He
must be off his head at moments. That jump-crazy! He'd have got a
verdict on that alone--if they'd seen those balconies.
I was looking at them when I was down there last Sunday. Daring
thing, Twisden. Very few men, on a dark night--He risked his life
twice. That's a shrewd fellow--young De Levis. He spotted Dancy's
nature.

The YOUNG CLERK enters.
CLERK. The taxi's here, sir. Will you see Major Colford and Miss
Orme?

TWISDEN. Graviter--No; show them in.
The YOUNG CLERK goes.

CANYNGE. Colford's badly cut up.
MARGARET ORME and COLFORD enter.
COLFORD. [Striding forward] There must be some mistake about this,
Mr Twisden.

TWISDEN. Hssh! Dancy's in there. He's admitted it.
Voices are subdued at once.
COLFORD. What? [With emotion] If it were my own brother, I couldn't
feel it more. But--damn it! What right had that fellow to chuck up
the case--without letting him know, too. I came down with Dancy
this morning, and he knew nothing about it.
TWISDEN. [Coldly] That was unfortunately unavoidable.
COLFORD. Guilty or not, you ought to have stuck to him--it's not
playing the game, Mr Twisden.

TWISDEN."Not to me."

"Yes, to you," he answered. "Babbie, you will return to the Spittal now, and tell Lord Rintoul
everything."

"If you wish it."

"Not because I wish it, but because it is right. He must be told that you do not love him."

"I never pretended to him that I did," Babbie said, looking up. "Oh," she added, with emphasis,
"he knows that. He thinks me incapable of caring for any one."

"And that is why he must be told of me," Gavin replied. "You are no longer the woman you were,
Babbie, and you know it, and I know it, but he does not know it. He shall know it before he
decides whether he is to marry you."

Babbie looked at Gavin, and wondered he did not see that this decision lay with him.

"Nevertheless," she said, "the wedding will take place to-morrow: if it did not, Lord Rintoul
would be the scorn of his friends."

"If it does," the minister answered, "he will be the scorn of himself. Babbie, there is a chance."

"There is no chance," she told him. "I shall be back at the Spittal without any one's knowing
of my absence, and when I begin to tell him of you, he will tremble, lest it means my refusal
to marry him; when he knows it does not, he will wonder only why I told him anything."

"He will ask you to take time--"

"No, he will ask me to put on my wedding-dress. You must not think anything else possible."

"So be it, then," Gavin said firmly.

"Yes, it will be better so," Babbie answered, and then, seeing him misunderstand her meaning,
exclaimed reproachfully, "I was not thinking of myself. In the time to come, whatever be my
lot, I shall have the one consolation, that this is best for you. Think of your mother."

"She will love you," Gavin said, "when I tell her of you."

"Yes," said Babbie, wringing her hands; "she will almost love me, but for what? For not marrying
you. That is the only reason any one in Thrums will have for wishing me well."

"No others," Gavin answered, "will ever know why I remained unmarried."

"Will you never marry?" Babbie asked, exultingly. "Ah!" she cried, ashamed, "but you must."

"Never."

Well, many a man and many a woman has made that vow in similar circumstances, and not all have
kept it. But shall we who are old smile cynically at the brief and burning passion of the young?
"The day," you say, "will come when--" Good sir, hold your peace. Their agony was great and
now is dead, and, maybe, they have forgotten where it lies buried; but dare you answer lightly
when I ask you which of these things is saddest?

Babbie believed his "Never," and, doubtless, thought no worse of him for it; but she saw no
way of comforting him save by disparagement of herself.

"You must think of your congregation," she said. "A minister with a gypsy wife--"

"Would have knocked them about with a flail," Gavin interposed, showing his teeth at the thought
of the precentor, "until they did her reverence."

She shook her head, and told him of her meeting with Micah Dow. It silenced him; not, however,
on account of its pathos, as she thought, but because it interpreted the riddle of Rob's behavior.

"Nevertheless," he said ultimately, "my duty is not to do what is right in my people's eyes,
but what seems right in my own."

Babbie had not heard him.

"I saw a face at the window just now," she whispered, drawing closer to him.

"There was no face there; the very thought of Rob Dow raises him before you," Gavin answered
reassuringly, though Rob was nearer at that moment than either of them thought.

"I must go away at once," she said, still with her eyes in the window. "No, no, you shall not
come or stay with me; it is you who are in danger."

"Do not fear for me."

"I must, if you will not. Before you came in, did I not hear you speak of a meeting you had
to attend to-night?"

"My pray--" His teeth met on the word; so abruptly did it conjure up the forgotten prayer-meeting
that before the shock could reach his mind he stood motionless, listening for the bell. For
one instant all that had taken place since he last heard it might have happened between two
of its tinkles; Babbie passed from before him like a figure in a panorama, and he saw, instead,
a congregation in their pews.

"What do you see?" Babbie cried in alarm, for he seemed to be gazing at the window.

"Only you," he replied, himself again; "I am coming with you."

"You must let me go alone," she entreated; "if not for your own safety"--but it was only him
she considered--"then for the sake of Lord Rintoul. Were you and I to be seen together now,
his name and mine might suffer."

It was an argument the minister could not answer save by putting his hands over his face; his
distress made Babbie strong; she moved to the door, trying to smile.

"Go, Babbie!" Gavin said, controlling his voice, though it had been a smile more pitiful than
her tears. "God has you in His keeping; it is not His will to give me this to bear for you."

They were now in the garden.

"Do not think of me as unhappy," she said; "it will be happiness to me to try to be all you
would have me be."

He ought to have corrected her. "All that God would have me be," is what she should have said.
But he only replied, "You will be a good woman, and none such can be altogether unhappy; God
sees to that."

He might have kissed her, and perhaps she thought so.

"I am--I am going now, dear," she said, and came back a step because he did not answer; then
she went on, and was out of his sight at three yards' distance. Neither of them heard the approaching
dogcart.

"You see, I am bearing it quite cheerfully," she said. "I shall have everything a woman loves;
do not grieve for me so much."

Gavin dared not speak nor move. Never had he found life so hard; but he was fighting with the
ignoble in himself, and winning. She opened the gate, and it might have been a signal to the
dogcart to stop. They both heard a dog barking, and then the voice of Lord Rintoul:

"That is a light in the window. Jump down, McKenzie, and inquire."

Gavin took one step nearer Babbie and stopped. He did not see how all her courage went from
her, so that her knees yielded, and she held out her arms to him, but he heard a great sob
and then his name.

"Gavin, I am afraid."

Gavin understood now, and I say he would have been no man to leave her after that; only a moment
was allowed him, and it was their last chance on earth. He took it. His arm went round his
beloved, and he drew her away from Nanny's.

McKenzie found both house and garden empty.

"And yet," he said, "I swear some one passed the window as we sighted it."

"Waste no more time," cried the impatient earl. "We must be very near the hill now. You will
have to lead the horse, McKenzie, in this darkness; the dog may find the way through the broom
for us."

"The dog has run on," McKenzie replied, now in an evil temper. "Who knows, it may be with her
now? So we must feel our way cautiously; there is no call for capsizing the trap in our haste."
But there was call for haste if they were to reach the gypsy encampment before Gavin and Babbie
were made man and wife over the tongs.

The Spittal dogcart rocked as it dragged its way through the broom. Rob Dow followed. The ten
o'clock bell began to ring.

CHAPTER XXXIII.

WHILE THE TEN O'CLOCK BELL WAS RINGING.

     In the square and wynds--weavers in groups:

"No, no, Davit, Mr. Dishart hadna felt the blow the piper gave him till he ascended the pulpit
to conduct the prayer-meeting for rain, and then he fainted awa. Tammas Whamond and Peter Tosh
carried him to the Session-house. Ay, an awful scene."

"How did the minister no come to the meeting? It has a principle, and that principle is a
patriotic desire to strengthen Prussia, which particular appetite
overweighs all general human morals and far outweighs all special
Christian or European morals.

This doctrine of the "Frederician Tradition" does not mean that the Prussian statesmen wantonly
do wrong, whether in acts of cruelty or in acts of treason and bad faith. What it means is
that, wherever they are met by the dilemma, "Shall I do _this_,
which is to the advantage of my country but opposed to European and
common morals, or _that_, which is consonant with those morals but
to the disadvantage of my country?"

they choose the former and not the latter course.

Prussia, endowed with this doctrine and possessed of a most excellent military organization and
tradition, stood out as the first military power in Europe until
the French Revolution.

The wars of the French Revolution and of Napoleon upset this prestige, and in the battle of
Jena (1806) seemed to have destroyed it. But it was too strong to be destroyed. The Prussian
Government was the first of Napoleon's allies to betray Napoleon _after_ the Russians had broken
his power (1812).

They took part with the other Allies in finishing off Napoleon after
the Russian campaign (1813-14); they were present with decisive
effect upon the final field of Waterloo (1815), and remained for
fifty years afterwards the great military power they had always been.

They had further added to their dominions such great areas in Northern Germany, beyond the
original areas inhabited by the true Prussian stock, that they were something like half of
the whole Northern German people when, in 1864, they entered into
the last phase of their dominion.

They began by asking Austria to help them in taking from Denmark, a small and weak country,
not only those provinces of hers which spoke German, but certain districts which were Danish
as well.

France and England were inclined to interfere, but they did not yet understand the menace Prussia
might be in the future, and they neglected to act.

     Two years later Prussia suddenly turned upon Austria, her ally,
defeated her in a very short campaign, and insisted upon Austria's
relinquishing for the future all claims over any part of the
German-speaking peoples, save some ten millions in the valley of
the Middle Danube and of the Upper Elbe.

Four years later again, in 1870, Prussia having arranged, after
various political experiments which need not be here detailed, for
the support of all the German States except Austria, fought a war
with France, in which she was immediately and entirely successful,
and in the course of which the rulers of the other German States
consented (1) to give the Hohenzollern-Prussian dynasty supreme
military power for the future over them, under the hereditary title
of German Emperors; (2) to form a united nation under the more or
less despotic power of these emperors.

This latter point, the national unity, though really highly centralized
at Berlin, especially on the military side, was softened in its
rigour by a number of very wise provisions.

A great measure of autonomy was left to the more important of the lesser States, particularly
Catholic Bavaria; local customs were respected; and, above all,
local dynasties were flattered, and maintained in all the trappings
of sovereign rank.

From that date--that is, for the last forty-four years--there has
been a complete _Northern_ Germany, one strong, centralized, and
thoroughly co-ordinated nation, in which the original Prussian
domination is not only numerically far the greatest element, but
morally overshadows all the rest.

The spiritual influence ruling this state issues from Berlin and from the Prussian soul,
although a large minority consist of contented but respectful
Catholics, who, in all national matters, wholly sympathize with and
take their cue from the Protestant North.

So far one may clearly see what kind of power it is that has initiated
the German theory of supremacy which we have described above, is
prepared to lead it to battle, and is quite certain of leading it
to victory.

But we note--the fatal mark in all German history--that the unity is not complete. The ten
millions of Austrian Germans were, when Prussia achieved this her
highest ambition, deliberately left outside the new German Empire.

And this was done because, in Prussian eyes, a so-called "German unity" was but a means to an
end, and that end the aggrandizement of the Hohenzollern dynasty.

To include so many southern and Catholic Germans would have endangered the mastery of Berlin.
The fact that Austria ruled a number of non-German subjects far
larger than her Austrian population would further have endangered
the Hohenzollern position had Austria been admitted to the new
German Empire, and had the consolidation of all Germans into one
true state been really and loyally attempted.

Lastly, it would have been impossible to destroy the historic claims
to leadership of the Imperial Hapsburgs, and that, more than anything
else, was the rivalry the Hohenzollerns dreaded.

     Once more had the Germans proved themselves incapable of, and
unwilling to submit to, the discipline of unity.

What part, then, was Austria, thus left out, to play in the
international activity of Prussia in the future?

What part especially was she to play when Prussia, at the head of
Northern Germany, should go out to impose the will of that Germany
and of herself upon the rest of the world?

That is the next question we must answer before we can hope to
understand the causes of the present war in their entirety

.

(4) AUSTRIA.

Austria, or, more strictly speaking, the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
means no more than the congeries of States governed each separately
and all in combination by the head of the House of Hapsburg-Lorraine.

Of these various States only one is German-speaking as a whole, and
that is the Austrian State proper, the "Eastern States" (for that
is what the word "Austria" originally meant) which Christendom
erected round the Roman and Christian frontier town of Vienna to
withstand the pressure of the heathen Slavs and Mongol Magyars
surging against it upon this frontier.

The complexity of the various sections which make up the realm of
the present Emperor Francis Joseph, the present head of the House
of Hapsburg-Lorraine, would be only confusing if it were detailed
in so general a description as this.

We must be content with the broad lines of the thing, which are as
follows:-- 
[Illustration: Sketch 3.]

From the Upper Danube and its valley--all the basin of it, one may
say, down to a point about twenty miles below Vienna--is the original
Austrian State; German-speaking as a whole, and the historic centre
of the entire agglomeration.

East of this is the far larger state of Hungary, and Hungary is the
valley of the river Danube, from where the German-speaking boundary
cuts it, just below Vienna down to the Iron Gates, up to the crest
of the Carpathians.

These two great units of Austria proper and of Hungary have round
them certain frills or edges.

On the north are two great bodies, Slav in origin, Bohemia and
Galicia; on the south another Slav body, separated from the rest
for centuries by the eruption of the Magyars from Asia in the Dark
Ages, and these Slav bodies are represented by Croatia, by much of
Dalmatia, and latterly by Bosnia and Herzegovina, which have been
governed by Austria for a generation, and formally annexed by her
with the consent of Europe seven years ago.

Finally, there is a strip, or, to be more accurate, there are patches
of Italian-speaking people, all along the coasts of the Adriatic,
and occupying the ports governed by Austria along the eastern and
northern coast of that sea.

There is also a belt of Alpine territory of Italian speech--the
Trentino--still in Austrian hands.

This very general description gives, however, far too rough an idea
of the extraordinarily complicated territories of the House of
Hapsburg.

Thus, there are considerable German-speaking colonies in Hungary,
and these, oddly enough, are more frequent in the east than in the
west of that State.

Again, the whole western slope of the Carpathians is, so far as the
mass of the population is concerned, Roumanian in tongue, custom,
and race.

Bohemia, though Slavonic in origin, is regularly enframed along its
four sides by belts of German-speaking people, and was mainly
German-speaking until a comparatively recent revival of its native
Slavonic tongue, the Czech.

Again, though the Magyar language is Mongolian, like the Turkish,
centuries of Christian and European admixture have left very little
trace of the original race.

Lastly, in all the north-eastern corner of this vast and heterogeneous
territory, something like a quarter of the population is Jewish.

The Western student, faced with so extraordinary a puzzle of race
and language, may well wonder what principle of unity there is lying
behind it, and, indeed, this principle of unity is not easy to find.

Some have sought it in religion, pointing out that the overwhelming
majority of these various populations are Catholic, in communion
with Rome; and, indeed, this Catholic tincture or colour has a great
deal to do with the Austro-Hungarian unity; and of late years the
chief directing policy of the House of Hapsburg-Lorraine has been
to pose as the leader of the Catholic Slavs against the Slavs
belonging to the Greek Church.

     But this principle of unity is not the true one, for two reasons:
first, that the motive leading the House of Hapsburg to the difficult
task of so complicated a government is not a religious motive; and,
secondly, because this religious unity is subject to profound
modification.

Hungary, though Catholic in its majority, contains, and is largely
governed by, powerful Protestant families, who are supported by
considerable bodies of Protestant population.

The Greek Church is the religious profession of great numbers along
the Lower Danube valley and to the south of the river Save.

There are in Bosnia a considerable number of Mahomedans even, and
I have already mentioned the numerous Jewish population of the
north-east, particularly in Galicia.

The true principle of unity in what has hitherto been the
Austro-Hungarian Empire is twofold.

It consists, first, in the reigning family, considerable personal
attachment to which is felt in every section of its dominions,
utterly different as these are one from another; and, secondly (a
more important point), in the historical development of the State.

It is this last matter which explains all, and which can make us
understand why a realm so astonishingly ill constructed was brought
into the present struggle as one force, and that force a force
allied to, and in a military sense identical with, modern Prussian
Germany.

For the historical root of Austria-Hungary is German. Of its population (some fifty-one
millions) you may say that only about a quarter are German-speaking
(less than another quarter are Magyar-speaking, most of the rest
Slavonic in speech, together with some proportion of Roumanian and
Italian).

But it is from this German _quarter_ and from the emperor at their
head that the historical growth of the State depends, because this
German _quarter_ was the original Christian nucleus and the civilized
centre, which had for its mission the reduction of Slavonic and
Magyar barbarism.

The Slavs of the Bohemian quadrilateral were subjected, not indeed by conquest, but by a
process of culture, to Vienna.

The crown of Hungary, when it fell by marriage to the Hapsburgs,
continued that tradition; and when the Empress Maria-Theresa, in
the last century, participated in the abominable crime of Frederick
the Great of Prussia, and took her share of the dismembered body
of Poland (now called the Austrian province of Galicia), that
enormous blunder was, in its turn, a German blunder undertaken under
the example of Northern Germany, and as part of a movement German
in spirit and origin.

The same is true even of the very latest of the Austrian developments, the annexation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina. The act was that of Vienna, but the spirit behind it, perhaps the suggestion
of it, and the support that made it possible came from Berlin.

     In a word, if you could interrogate the Genius of the Hapsburgs and
ask it for what their dominion stood, it would tell you that for
uninterrupted centuries they had stood for the German effort to
repress or to overcome pressure upon the German peoples from the
East.

And that is still their rôle.

They have come into this war, for instance, as the servants of
Prussia, not because Prussia threatened or overawed them, but because
they felt they had, in common with Prussia, the mission of withstanding
the Slav, or of tolerating the Slav only as a subject; because,
that is, they feared, and were determined to resist, Russia, and
the smaller Slavonic States, notably Servia to the south, which are
in the retinue of Russia

.

* * * * *

We may sum up, then, and say that the fundamental conflict of wills in Europe, which has produced
this general war, is a conflict between the German will, organized by Prussia to overthrow
the ancient Christian tradition of Europe (to _her_ advantage directly; and indirectly, as
she proposes, to the advantage of a supposedly necessary German
governance of the world under Prussian organization), and the will
of the more ancient and better founded Western and Latin tradition
to which the sanctity of separate national units profoundly appeals,
and a great deal more which is, in their eyes, civilization.

In this conflict, Prussia has called upon and received the support of not only the German Empire,
which she controls, but also the Hapsburg monarchy, controlling
the organized forces of Austria-Hungary; while there has appeared
against this strange Prussian claim all that values the Christian
tradition of Europe, and in particular the doctrine of national
freedom, with very much else--which very much else are the things
by which we of the civilized West and South, who have hitherto
proved the creators of the European world, live and have our being.

Allied with us, by the accident that this same German claim threatens
them also, is the young new world of the Slavs.

It is at this final point of our examination that we may see the
immensity of the issues upon which the war turns.

The two parties are really fighting for their lives; that in Europe
which is arrayed against the Germanic alliance would not care to
live if it should fail to maintain itself against the threat of
that alliance.

It is for them life and death. On the other side, the Germans having propounded this theory of
theirs, or rather the Prussians having propounded it for them, there is no rest possible until
they shall either have "made good" to our destruction, or shall have been so crushed that a
recurrence of the menace from them will for the future be impossible.

There is here no possibility of such a "draw" or "stalemate" as was the result, for instance,
of the reduction of Louis XIV.'s ambition, or of the great revolutionary effort throughout
Europe which ended with the fall of Napoleon. Louis XIV.'s ambition cast over Europe, which
received it favourably, the colour of French culture. The Revolutionary Wars were fought for
a principle which, if it did not appeal universally to men, appealed at least to all those
millions whose instincts were democratic in every country. But in this war there is no such
common term. No one outside the districts led by Prussia desires a Prussian life, and perhaps
most, certainly many, of those whom Prussia now leads are in different degrees unwilling
to continue a Prussian life. The fight, in a word, is not like a fight with a man who, if
he beats you, may make you sign away some property, or make you acknowledge some principle to
which you are already half inclined; it is like a fight with a man
who says, "So long as I have life left in me, I will make it my
business to kill you."

And fights of that kind can never reach a term less absolute than the destruction of offensive
power in one side or the other.

A peace not affirming complete victory in this great struggle could,
of its nature, be no more than a truce

.

* * * * *

So much for the really important and the chief thing which we have
to understand--the general causes of the war.

Now let us turn to the particular causes. We shall find these to be, not like the general causes,
great spiritual attitudes, but, as they always are, a sequence of restricted and recent
_events_.

(5) THE PARTICULAR CAUSES OF THE WAR.

After the great victories of Prussia a generation ago (the spoliation
of Denmark in 1864, the supremacy established over Austria in 1866,
the crushing defeat of France and the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine,
with two millions of people in 1870-1), Europe gradually drifted
into being an armed camp, the great forces of which were more or
less in equilibrium.

Prussia had, for the moment at least, achieved all that she desired.

The French were for quite twenty years ardently desirous of recovering what they had lost; but
Europe would not allow the war to be renewed, and Prussia, now at
the head of a newly constituted German Empire, made an arrangement
with Austria and with Italy to curb the French desire for recovery.

The French, obviously inferior before this triple alliance, gradually
persuaded the Russians to support them; but the Russians would not
support the French in provoking another great war, and with the
French themselves the old feeling gradually deadened.

It did not disappear--any incident might have revived it--but the anxious desire for immediate
war when the opportunity should come got less and less, and at the
end of the process, say towards 1904, when a new generation had
grown up in all the countries concerned, there was a sort of deadlock,
every one very heavily armed, the principal antagonists, France and
Germany, armed to their utmost, but the European States, as a whole,
unwilling to allow any one of them to break the peace.

It was about this moment that Prussia committed what the future historian will regard, very
probably, as the capital blunder in her long career of success. She began to build a great
fleet. Here the reader should note two very important consequences of the great Prussian
victories which had taken place a generation before. The first was the immense expansion of
German industrialism.

Germany, from an agricultural State, became a State largely occupied in mining, smelting, spinning,
and shipbuilding; and there went with this revolution, as there
always goes with modern industrialism, a large and unhealthy increase
of population.

The German Empire, after its war with France, was roughly equal to
the population of the French; but the German Empire, after this
successful industrial experiment, the result of its victories, was
much more than half as large again in population as the French (68
to 39).

Secondly, the German Empire developed a new and very large maritime
commerce.

This second thing did not follow, as some have imagined it does, from the first. Germany might
have exported largely without exporting in her own ships. The creation of Germany's new mercantile
marine was a deliberate part of the general Prussian policy of expansion. It was heavily
subsidized, especially directed into the form of great international passenger lines, and
carefully co-ordinated with the rest of the Prussian scheme throughout the world.

At a date determined by the same general policy, and somewhat subsequent to the first creation of
this mercantile marine, came the decision to build a great fleet.

Now, it so happens that Great Britain alone among the Powers of Europe depends for her
existence upon supremacy at sea, and particularly upon naval superiority in the Narrow Seas
to the east and the south of the British islands.

Such a necessity is, of course, a challenge to the rest of the world, and it would be ridiculous
to expect the rest of the world to accept that challenge without
protest.

But a necessity this naval policy of Great Britain remains none the less. The moment some
rival or group of rivals can overcome her fleet, her mere physical livelihood is in peril. She
cannot be certain of getting her food. She cannot be certain of getting those foreign
materials the making up of which enables her to purchase her food. Further, her dominions are
scattered oversea, and supremacy at sea is her only guarantee of retaining the various
provinces of her dominion.

It is a case which has happened more than once before in the history
of the world.

Waster Lunny's corn-field
looked like a bog grown over with rushes, and what had been his turnips had become a lake with
small islands in it. No dike stood whole except one that the farmer, unaided, had built in
a straight line from the road to the top of Mount Bare, and my own, the further end of which
dipped in water. Of the plot of firs planted fifty years earlier to help on Waster Lunny's
crops, only a triangle had withstood the night.

Even with the aid of my field-glass I could not estimate the damage on more distant farms,
for the rain, though now thin and soft, as it continued for six days, was still heavy and of
a brown color. After breakfast--which was interrupted by my bantam cock's twice spilling my
milk--saw Waster Lunny and his son, Matthew, running towards the shepherd's house with ropes
in their hands. The house, I thought, must be in the midst beyond; and then I sickened, knowing
all at once that it should be on this side of the mist. When I had nerve to look again, I saw
that though the roof had fallen in, the shepherd was astride one of the walls, from which he
was dragged presently through the water by the help of the ropes. I remember noticing that
he returned to his house with the rope still about him. and concluded that he had gone back
to save some of his furniture. I was wrong, however. There was too much to be done at the farm
to allow this, but Waster Lunny had consented to Duncan's forcing his way back to the shieling
to stop the clock. To both men it seemed horrible to let a clock go on ticking in a deserted house.

Having seen this rescue accomplished, I was letting my glass roam in the opposite direction,
when one of its shakes brought into view something on my own side of the river. I looked at
it long, and saw it move slightly. Was it a human being? No, it was a dog. No, it was a dog
and something else. I hurried out to see more clearly, and after a first glance the glass shook
so in my hands that I had to rest it on the dike. For a full minute, I daresay, did I look
through the glass without blinking, and then I needed to look no more, That black patch was,
indeed, Gavin.

He lay quite near the school-house, but I had to make a circuit of half a mile to reach him.
It was pitiful to see the dog doing its best to come to me, and falling every few steps. The
poor brute was discolored almost beyond recognition; and when at last it reached me, it lay
down at my feet and licked them. I stepped over it and ran on recklessly to Gavin. At first
I thought he was dead. If tears rolled down my cheeks, they were not for him.

I was no strong man even in those days, but I carried him to the school-house, the dog crawling
after us. Gavin I put upon my bed, and I lay down beside him, holding him close to me, that
some of the heat of my body might be taken in by his. When he was able to look at me, however,
it was not with understanding, and in vain did my anxiety press him with questions. Only now
and again would some word in my speech strike upon his brain and produce at least an echo.
To "Did you meet Lord Rintoul's dogcart?" he sat up, saying quickly:

"Listen, the dogcart!"

"Egyptian" was not that forenoon among the words he knew, and I did not think of mentioning
"hill." At "rain" he shivered; but "Spittal" was what told me most.

"He has taken her back," he replied at once, from which I learned that Gavin now knew as much
of Babbie as I did.

I made him as comfortable as possible, and despairing of learning anything from him in his
present state, I let him sleep. Then I went out into the rain, very anxious, and dreading what
he might have to tell me when he woke. I waded and jumped my way as near to the farm as I dared
go, and Waster Lunny, seeing me, came to the water's edge. At this part the breadth of the
flood was not forty yards, yet for a time our voices could no more cross its roar than one
may send a snowball through a stone wall. I know not whether the river then quieted for a space,
or if it was only that the ears grow used to dins as the eyes distinguish the objects in a
room that is at first black to them; but after a little we were able to shout our remarks across,
much as boys fling pebbles, many to fall into the water, but one occasionally to reach the
other side. Waster Lunny would have talked of the flood, but I had not come here for that.

"How were you home so early from the prayer-meeting last night?" I bawled.

"No meeting ... I came straucht hame ... but terrible stories ... Mr. Dishart," was all I caught
after Waster Lunny had flung his words across a dozen times.

I could not decide whether it would be wise to tell him that Gavin was in the school-house,
and while I hesitated he continued to shout:

"Some woman ... the Session ... Lang Tammas ... God forbid ... maun back to the farm ... byre
running like a mill-dam."

He signed to me that he must be off, but my signals delayed him, and after much trouble he
got my question, "Any news about Lord Rintoul?" My curiosity about the earl must have surprised
him, but he answered:

"Marriage is to be the day ... cannon."

I signed that I did not grasp his meaning.

"A cannon is to be fired as soon as they're man and wife," he bellowed. "We'll hear it."

With that we parted. On my way home, I remember, I stepped on a brood of drowned partridge.
I was only out half an hour, but I had to wring my clothes as if they were fresh from the tub.

The day wore on, and I did not disturb the sleeper. A dozen times, I suppose, I had to relight
my fire of wet peats and roots; but I had plenty of time to stare out at the window, plenty
of time to think. Probably Gavin's life depended on his sleeping, but that was not what kept
my hands off him. Knowing so little of what had happened in Thrums since I left it, I was forced
to guess, and my conclusion was that the earl had gone off with his own, and that Gavin in
a frenzy had followed them. My wisest course, I thought, was to let him sleep until I heard
the cannon, when his struggle for a wife must end. Fifty times at least did I stand regarding
him as he slept; and if I did not pity his plight sufficiently, you know the reason. What were
Margaret's sufferings at this moment? Was she wringing her hands for her son lost in the flood,
her son in disgrace with the congregation? By one o'clock no cannon had sounded, and my suspense
had become intolerable. I shook Gavin awake, and even as I shook him demanded a knowledge of
all that had happened since we parted at Nanny's gate.

"How long ago is that?" he asked, with bewilderment.

"It was last night," I answered. "This morning I found you senseless on the hillside, and brought
you here, to the Glen Quharity school-house. That dog was with you."

He looked at the dog, but I kept my eyes on him, and I saw intelligence creep back, like a
blush, into his face.

"Now I remember," he said, shuddering. "You have proved yourself my friend, sir, twice in the
four and twenty hours."

"Only once, I fear," I replied gloomily. "I was no friend when I sent you to the earl's bride
last night."

"You know who she is?" he cried, clutching me, and finding it agony to move his limbs.

"I know now," I said, and had to tell him how I knew before he would answer another question.
Then I became listener, and you who read know to what alarming story.

"And all that time," I cried reproachfully, when he had done, "you gave your mother not a thought."

"Not a thought," he answered; and I saw that he pronounced a harsher sentence on himself than
could have come from me. "All that time!" he repeated, after a moment. "It was only a few minutes,
while the ten o'clock bell was ringing."

"Only a few minutes," I said, "but they changed the channel of the Quharity, and perhaps they
have done not less to you."

"That may be," he answered gravely, "but it is of the present I must think just now. Mr. Ogilvy,
what assurance have I, while lying here helpless, that the marriage at the Spittal is not going
on?"

"None, I hope," I said to myself, and listened longingly for the cannon. But to him I only
pointed out that no woman need go through a form of marriage against her will.

"Rintoul carried her off with no possible purport," he said, "but to set my marriage at defiance,
and she has had a conviction always that to marry me would be to ruin me. It was only in the
shiver Lord Rintoul's voice in the darkness sent through her that she yielded to my wishes.
If she thought that marriage last night could be annulled by another to-day, she would consent
to the second, I believe, to save me from the effects of the first. You are incredulous, sir;
but you do not know of what sacrifices love is capable."

Something of that I knew, but I did not tell him. I had seen from his manner rather than his
words that he doubted the validity of the gypsy marriage, which the king had only consented
to celebrate because Babbie was herself an Egyptian. The ceremony had been interrupted in the
middle.

"It was no marriage," I said, with a confidence I was far from feeling.

"In the sight of God," he replied excitedly, "we took each other for man and wife."

I had to hold him down in bed.

"You are too weak to stand, man," I said, "and yet you think you could start off this minute
for the Spittal."

"I must go," he cried. "She is my wife. That impious marriage may have taken place already."

"Oh, that it had!" was my prayer. "It has not," I said to him. "A cannon is to be fired immediately
after the ceremony, and all the glen will hear it." I spoke on the impulse, thinking to allay
his desire to be off; but he said, "Then I may yet be in time." Somewhat cruelly I let him
rise, that he might realize his weakness. Every bone in him cried out at his first step, and
he sank into a chair.

"You will go to the Spittal for me?" he implored.

"I will not," I told him. "You are asking me to fling away my life."

To prove my words I opened the door, and he saw what the flood was doing. Nevertheless, he
rose and tottered several times across the room, trying to revive his strength. Though every
bit of him was aching, I saw that he would make the attempt.

"Listen to me," I said. "Lord Rintoul can maintain with some reason that it was you rather
than he who abducted Babbie. Nevertheless, there will not, I am convinced, be any marriage
at the Spittal to-day, When he carried her off from the Toad's-hole, he acted under impulses
not dissimilar to those that took you to it. Then, I doubt not, he thought possession was all
the law, but that scene on the hill has staggered him by this morning. Even though she thinks
to save you by marrying him, he will defer his wedding until he learns the import of yours."

I did not believe in my own reasoning, but I would have said anything to detain him until that
cannon was fired. He seemed to read my purpose, for he pushed my arguments from him with his
hands, and continued to walk painfully to and fro.

"To defer the wedding," he said, "would be to tell all his friends of her gypsy origin, and
of me. He will risk much to avoid that."

"In any case," I answered, "you must now give some thought to those you have forgotten, your
mother and your church."

"That must come afterwards," he said firmly. "My first duty is to my wife."

The door swung to sharply just then, and he started. He thought it was the cannon.

"I wish to God it had been!" I cried, interpreting his thoughts.

"Why do you wish me ill?" he asked.

"Mr. Dishart," I said solemnly, rising and facing him, and disregarding his question, "if that
woman is to be your wife, it will be at a cost you cannot estimate till you return to Thrums.
The name of a deity was often kept secret and not allowed to be written down, as among the
Jews.

9. _Regeneration._--The idea of regeneration seldom occurs in the New Testament, and perhaps
not at all in connexion with baptism; for in the conversation with Nicodemus, John iii.
3-8, the words "of water and" in v. 5 offend the context, spiritual re-birth alone being
insisted upon in vv. 3, 6, 7 and 8; moreover, Justin Martyr, who cites v. 5, seems to omit them.
Nor is there any mention of water in ch. i. 13, where, according
to the oldest text, Christ is represented as having been born or
begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the
will of man, but of God.

In 1 Pet. i. 3, it is said of the saints that God the Father begat
them anew unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus, and in
v. 23 that they have been begotten again, not of corruptible seed,
but of incorruptible through the word of God.

But here again it is not clear that the writer has in view water baptism or any rite at all as
the means and occasion of regeneration.
In the conversation with Nicodemus we seem to overhear a protest against the growing tendency
of the last years of the 1st century to substitute formal sacraments for the free afflatus
of the spirit, and to "crib, cabin and confine" the gift of prophecy.

The passage where re-birth is best put forward in connexion with baptism is Luke iii. 22, where
ancient texts, including the _Gospel of the Hebrews_, read, "Thou art my beloved Son, this day
have I begotten Thee." These words were taken in the sense that Jesus was then re-born of
the Spirit an adoptive Son of God and Messiah; and with this reading is bound up the entire adoptionist
school of Christology.

It apparently underlies the symbolizing of Christ as a fish in the
art of the catacombs, and in the literature of the 2nd century.

Tertullian prefaces with this idea his work on baptism. _Nos pisciculi secundum_ [Greek: ICHTHUN]
_nostrum Jesum Christum in aqua nascimur_. "We little fishes, after the example of our
_Fish_ Jesus Christ, are _born_ in the water." So about the year 440 the Gaulish poet Orientius
wrote of Christ; _Piscis natus aquis, auctor baptismatis ipse est_.

"A fish born of the waters is himself originator of baptism."

But before his time and within a hundred years of Tertullian this symbolism in its original
significance had become heretical, and the orthodox were thrown back on another explanation
of it. This was that the word [Greek: ICHTHUS] is made up of the letters which begin the Greek
words meaning "Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour."

An entire mythology soon grew up around the idea of re-birth. The font was viewed as the womb
of the virgin mother church, who was in some congregations, for example, in the early churches
of Gaul, no abstraction, but a divine aeon watching over and
sympathizing with the children of her womb, the recipient even of
hymns of praise and humble supplications.

Other mythoplastic growths succeeded, one of which must be noticed. The sponsors or _anadochi_,
who, after the introduction of infant baptism came to be called
god-fathers and god-mothers, were really in a spiritual relation
to the children they took up out of the font.

This relation was soon by the canonists identified with the blood-tie
which connects real parents with their offspring, and the corollary
drawn that children, who in baptism had the same god-parent, were
real brothers and sisters, who might not marry either each the other
or real children of the said god-parent.

The reformed churches have set aside this fiction, but in the Latin and Eastern churches it
has created a distinct and very powerful marriage taboo.

10.

_Relation to Repentance.

_--Baptism justified the believer, that is to say, constituted him
a saint whose past sins were abolished.

Sin after baptism excluded the sinner afresh from the divine grace
and from the sacraments.

He fell back into the status of a catechumen, and it was much
discussed from the 2nd century onwards whether he could be restored
to the church at all, and, if so, how.

A rite was devised, called _exhomologesis_, by which, after a fresh
term of repentance, marked by austerities more strict than any
Trappist monk imposes on himself to-day, the persons lapsed from
grace could re-enter the church.

In effect this rite was a repetition of baptism, the water of the
font alone being omitted.

Such restoration could in the earlier church only be effected once.

A second lapse from the state of grace entailed perpetual exclusion from the sacraments, the
means of salvation. As has been remarked above, the terror of post-baptismal sin and the
fact that only one restoration was allowable influenced many as late as the 4th century to
remain catechumens all their lives, and, like Constantine, to receive baptism on the [v.03
p.0368] deathbed alone. The same scruples endured among the medieval Cathars. (See PENANCE
and NOVATIANUS.)
11. _Baptism for the Dead.

_--Paul, in 1 Cor. xv. 29, glances at this as an established practice familiar to those whom he
addresses. Three explanations are possible: (1) The saints before they were quickened or made
alive together with Christ, were dead through their trespasses and sins. In baptism they were
buried with Christ and rose, like Him, from the dead.

We can, therefore, paraphrase v. 29 thus: "Else what shall they do which are baptized for
their dead selves?" &c. It is in behalf of his own sinful, _i.e._ dead self, that the sinner is
baptized and receives eternal life. (2) Contact with the dead
entailed a pollution which lasted at least a day and must be washed
away by ablutions, before a man is re-admitted to religious cult.

This was the rule among the Jews. Is it possible that the words "for the dead" signify "because
of contact with the dead"? (3) Both these explanations are forced, and it is more probable
that by a make-believe common in all religions, and not unknown
in the earliest church, the sins of dead relatives, about whose
salvation their survivors were anxious, were transferred into living
persons, who assumed for the nonce their names and were baptized
in their behalf, so in vicarious wise rendering it possible for the
sins of the dead to be washed away.

The Mormons have this rite. The idea of transferring sin into another man or into an animal,
and so getting it purged through him or it, was widespread in the age of Paul and long
afterwards.
Chrysostom says that the substitutes were put into the beds of the
deceased, and assuming the voice of the dead asked for baptism and
remission of sins.

Tertullian and others attest this custom among the followers of Cerinthus and Marcion.

12. _Use of the Name.

_--In Acts iv. 7, the rulers and priests of the Jews summon Peter and inquire by what power or in
what name he has healed the lame. Here a belief is assumed which
pervades ancient magic and religion.

Only so far as we can get away from the modern view that a person's
name is a trifling accident, and breathe the atmosphere which broods
over ancient religions, can we understand the use of the name in
baptisms, exorcisms, prayers, purifications and consecrations.

For a name carried with it, for those who were so blessed as to be acquainted with it, whatever
power and influence its owner wielded in heaven or on earth or under the earth. A vow or prayer
formulated in or through a certain name was fraught with the prestige of him whose name it was.
Thus the psalmist addressing Jehovah cries (Ps. liv. 1): "Save me,
O God, by Thy name, and judge me in Thy might."

And in Acts iii. 16, it is the name itself which renders strong and
whole the man who believed therein.

In Acts xviii. 15, the Jews assail Paul because he has trusted and appealed to the name of a
Messiah whom they regard as an overthrower of the law; for Paul believed that God had invested
Jesus with a name above all names, potent to constrain and overcome all lesser powers, good
or evil, in heaven or earth or under earth.

Baptism then in the name or through the name or into the name of Christ placed the believer
under the influence and tutelage of Christ's personality, as before
he was in popular estimation under the influence of stars and
horoscope.

Nay, more, it imported that personality into him, making him a limb
or member of Christ's body, and immortal as Christ was immortal.

Nearly all the passages in which the word _name_ is used in the New
Testament become more intelligible if it be rendered _personality_.

In Rev. xi. 13, the revisers are obliged to render it by _persons_,
and should equally have done so in iii. 4: "Thou hast a few _names_
(i.e. persons) in Sardis which did not defile their garments."

(See CONSECRATION.)
13. _Origin of Christian Baptism.

_--When it is asked, Was this a continuance of the baptism of John or was it merely the baptism
of proselytes?--a distinction is implied between the two latter which was not always real. In
relation to the publicans and soldiers who, smitten with remorse, sought out John in the
wilderness, his baptism was a purification from their past and so far identical with the proselyte's
bath; but so far as it raised them up to be children unto Abraham
and filled them with the Messianic hope, it advanced them further
than that bath could do, and assured them of a place in the kingdom
of God, soon to be established--this, without imposing circumcision
on them; for the ordinary proselyte was circumcised as well as
baptized.

For the Jews, however, who came to John, his baptism could not have the significance of the
proselyte's baptism, but rather accorded with another baptism
undergone by Jews who wished to consecrate their lives by stricter
study and practice of the law.

So Epictetus remarks that he only really understands Judaism who
knows "the baptized Jew" ([Greek: ton bebammenon]).

We gather from Acts xix. 4, that John had merely baptized in the name of the coming Messiah,
without identifying him with Jesus of Nazareth. The apostolic age supplied this identification,
and the normal use during it seems to have been "into Christ Jesus,"
or "in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ," or "of Jesus Christ"
simply, or "of the Lord Jesus Christ."

Paul explains these formulas as being equivalent to "into the death of Christ Jesus," as if the
faithful were in the rite raised from death into everlasting life.

The _likeness_ of the baptismal ceremony with Christ's death and resurrection ensured a real
union with him of the believer who underwent the ceremony, according to the well-known principle
_in sacris simulata pro veris accipi_.

But opinion was still fluid about baptism in the apostolic age, especially as to its connexion
with the descent of the Spirit.

The Spirit falls on the disciples and others at Pentecost without any baptism at all, and
Paul alone of the apostles was baptized.

So far was the afflatus of the Spirit from being conditioned by the rite, that in Acts x. 44 ff., the
gift of the Spirit was first poured out upon the Gentiles who heard
the word preached so that they spoke with tongues, and it was only
after these manifestations that they were baptized with water in
the name of Jesus Christ at the instance of Peter.

We can divine from this passage why Paul was so eager himself to preach the word, and left
it to others to baptize.

But as a rule the repentant underwent baptism in the name of Christ Jesus, and washed away their
sins before hands were laid upon them unto reception of the Spirit. Apollos, who only knew
the baptism of John (Acts xviii. 24), needed only instruction in the prophetic _gnosis_ at the
hands of Priscilla and Aquila in order to become a full disciple. On the other hand, in Acts
xix. 1-7, twelve disciples, for such they were already accounted, who had been baptized into
John's baptism, _i.e._ into the name of him that should follow John, but had not even heard of the
Holy Spirit, are at Paul's instance re-baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
Then Paul himself lays hands on them and the Holy Ghost comes upon
them, so that they speak with tongues and prophecy.

Not only do we hear of these varieties of practice, but also of the laying on of hands together
with prayer as a substantive rite unconnected with baptism.

The seven deacons were so ordained. And this rite of laying on hands, which was in antiquity
a recognized way of transmitting the occult power or virtue of one man into another, is used in
Acts ix. 17, by Ananias, in order that Paul may recover his sight and be filled with the Holy
Ghost. Saul and Barnabas equally are separated for a certain missionary work by imposition of
hands with prayer and fasting, and are so sent forth by the Holy
Ghost.

It was also a way of healing the sick (Acts xxviii. 8), and as such accompanied by anointing with
oil (Jas. v.
14). The Roman church then had early precedents for separating confirmation from baptism.
It would also appear that in the primitive age confirmation and ordination were one and the
same rite; and so they continued to be among the dissident believers of the middle ages, who,
however, often dropped the water rite altogether. (See CATHARS.) More than one sect of the 2nd
century rejected water baptism on the ground that knowledge of the truth in itself makes us free,
and that external material washing of a perishable body cannot contribute to the illumination
of the inner man, complete without it.

St Paul himself recognizes (1 Cor. vii. 14) that children, one of whose parents only is a believer,
are _ipso facto_ not unclean, but _holy_. Even an unbelieving husband or wife is _sanctified_
by a believing partner. If we remember the force of the words [Greek: hagios hagiazô] (cf. 1
Cor. [v.03 p.0369] i. 2), here used of children and parents, we realize how far off was St
Paul from the positions of Augustine.

The question arises whether Jesus Himself instituted baptism as a
condition of entry into the Messianic kingdom.

The fourth gospel (iii. 22, and iv. 1) asserts that Jesus Himself
baptized on a greater scale than the Baptist, but immediately adds
that Jesus Himself baptized not, but only His disciples, as if the
writer felt that he had too boldly contradicted the older tradition
of the other gospels.

Nor in these is it recorded that the disciples baptized during their Master's lifetime; indeed
the very contrary is implied.

There remain two texts in which the injunction to baptize is
attributed to Jesus, namely, Mark xvi. 16 and Matt. xxviii. 18-20.

Of these the first is part of an appendix headed "of Ariston the
elder" in an old Armenian codex, and taken perhaps from the lost
compilations of Papias; as to the other text, it has been doubted
by many critics, _e.g._ Neander, Harnack, Dr Armitage Robinson and
James Martineau, whether it represents a real utterance of Christ
and not rather the liturgical usage of the region in which the first
gospel was compiled.

The circumstance, unknown to these critics when they made their
conjectures, that Eusebius Pamphili, in nearly a score of citations,
substitutes the words "in My Name" for the words "baptizing them
into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,"
renders their conjectures superfluous.

Aphraates also in citing the verse substitutes "and they shall believe in Me"--a paraphrase of "in
My Name." The first gospel thus falls into line with the rest of the New Testament.

14. _Analogous Rites in other Religions_ (see also PURIFICATION).--The Fathers themselves
were the first to recognize that "the devil too had his sacraments,"
and that the Eleusinian, Isiac, Mithraic and other _mystae_ used
baptism in their rites of initiation.

But it is not to be supposed that the Christians borrowed from these
or from any Gentile source any essential features of their baptismal
rites.

Baptism was long before the advent of Jesus imposed on proselytes, and existed inside Judaism
itself.

It has been remarked that the developed ceremony of baptism, with its threefold renunciation,
resembles the ceremony of Roman law known as _emancipatio_, by which the _patria potestas_ (or
power of life and death of the father over his son) was extinguished.
Under the law of the XII.

Tables the father lost it, if he three times sold his child. This suggested a regular procedure,
according to which the father sold his son thrice into _mancipium_, while after each sale the
fictitious vendee enfranchized the son, by _manumissio vindicta_, _i.e._ by laying his rod
(_vindicta_) on the slave and claiming him as free (_vindicatio in libertatem_). Then the
owner also laid his rod on the slave, declaring his intention to enfranchise him, and the
_praetor_ by his _addictor_ confirmed the owner's declaration. The third _manumission_ thus
gave to the son and slave his freedom. It is possible that this common ceremony of Roman law
suggested the triple _abrenunciatio_ of Satan.

Like the legal ceremony, baptism freed the believer from one (Satan) who, by the mere fact of
the believer's birth, had power of death over him.
And as the legal manumission dissolved a son's previous agnatic relationships, so, too, the
person baptized gave up father and mother, &c., and became one of a society of brethren the
bond between whom was not physical but spiritual. The idea of adoption in baptism as a son
and heir of God was almost certainly taken by Paul from Roman law.

The ceremony of turning to the west three times with renunciation
of the Evil One, then to the east, is exactly paralleled in a rite
of purification by water common among the Malays and described by
Skeat in his book on Malay magic.

If the Malay rite is not derived through Mahommedanism from Christianity, it is a remarkable
example of how similar psychological conditions can produce almost identical rites.

Sometimes she looked furtively at me, and I knew her thoughts. To me it was only misery that
had come, but to her it was shame, so that when you woke and climbed into her lap she shivered
at your touch. I could not look at her after that, for there was a horror of me growing in
her face.

"Ten o'clock struck, and then again there was no sound but the sea pouring itself out on the
beach. It was long after this, when to me there was still no other sound, that Margaret screamed,
and you hid behind her. Then I heard it.

"'Gavin,' Margaret said to me, 'be a good man all your life.'

"It was louder now, and then it stopped. Above the wash of the sea we heard another sound--a
sharp tap, tap. You said, 'I know what sound that is; it's a man knocking the ashes out of
his pipe against his boot.'

"Then the dog pushed the door off the latch, and Adam lurched in. He was not drunk, but he
brought the smell of drink into the room with him. He was grinning like one bringing rare news,
and before she could shrink back or I could strike him he had Margaret in his arms.

"'Lord, lass,' he said, with many jovial oaths, 'to think I'm back again! There, she's swounded.
What folks be women, to be sure.'

"'We thought you were dead, Adam," she said, coming to.

'"Bless your blue eyes," he answered gleefully; 'often I says to myself, "Meggy will be thinking
I'm with the fishes," and then I chuckles.'

"'Where have you been all this time?' I demanded sternly.

"'Gavin,' he said effusively, 'your hand. And don't look so feared, man; I bear no malice for
what you've done. I heard all about it at the Cross Anchors.'

"'Where have you been these five years and a half?' I repeated.

"'Where have I no been, lad?' he replied.

"'At Harvie,' I said.

"'Right you are,' said he good-naturedly. 'Meggie, I had no intention of leaving you that day,
though I was yawning myself to death in Harvie; but I sees a whaler, and I thinks, "That's
a tidy boat, and I'm a tidy man, and if they'll take me and the dog, off we go."'

"'You never wrote to me,' Margaret said."

'"I meant to send you some scrapes,' he answered, 'but it wasna till I changed ships that I
had the chance, and then I minds, "Meggy kens I'm no hand with the pen." But I swear I often
thought of you, lass; and look you here, that's better than letters, and so is that, and every
penny of it is yours.'"

"He flung two bags of gold upon the table, and their chink brought you out from behind your mother.

"'Hallo!' Adam cried.

"'He is mine,' I said. 'Gavin, come here.' But Margaret held you back.

"'Here's a go,' Adam muttered, and scratched his head. Then he slapped his thigh. 'Gavin,'
he said, in his friendliest way, 'we'll toss for him.'

"He pulled the knife that is now in my desk from his pocket, spat on it, and flung it up. 'Dry,
the kid's ours, Meggy,' he explained; 'wet, he goes to Gavin,' I clinched my fist to---But
what was the use? He caught the knife, and showed it to me.

"'Dry,' he said triumphantly; 'so he is ours, Meggy. Kiddy, catch the knife. It is yours; and,
mind, you have changed dads. And now that we have settled that, Gavin, there's my hand again.'

"I went away and left them, and I never saw Margaret again until the day you brought her to
Thrums. But I saw you once, a few days after Adam came back. I was in the school-house, packing
my books, and you were playing on the waste ground. I asked you how your mother was, and you
said, 'She's fleid to come to the door till you gang awa, and my father's buying a boat.'

"'I'm your father,' I said; but you answered confidently:

"'You're no a living man. You're just a man I dreamed about; and I promised my mother no to
dream about you again.'

"'I am your father,' I repeated.

"'My father's awa buying a fishing-boat,' you insisted; 'and when I speir at my mother whaur
my first father is, she says I'm havering.'

"'Gavin Ogilvy is your name,' I said. 'No,' you answered, 'I have a new name. My mother telled
me my name is aye to be Gavin Dishart now. She telled me, too, to fling awa this knife my father
gave me, and I've flung it awa a lot o' times, but I aye pick it up again.'

"'Give it to me,' I said, with the wicked thoughts of a fool in my head.

"That is how your knife came into my possession. I left Harvie that night in the carrier's
cart, but I had not the heart to return to college. Accident brought me here, and I thought
it a fitting place in which to bury myself from Margaret."

 Chapter XXXVII

SECOND JOURNEY OF THE DOMINIE TO THRUMS DURING THE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS.

Here was a nauseous draught for me. Having finished my tale, I turned to Gavin for sympathy;
and, behold, he had been listening for the cannon instead of to my final words. So, like an
old woman at her hearth, we warm our hands at our sorrows and drop in faggots, and each thinks
his own fire a sun, in presence of which all other fires should go out. I was soured to see
Gavin prove this, and then I could have laughed without mirth, for had not my bitterness proved
it too?

"And now," I said, rising, "whether Margaret is to hold up her head henceforth lies no longer
with me, but with you."

It was not to that he replied.

"You have suffered long, Mr. Ogilvy," he said. "Father," he added, wringing my hand. I called
him son; but it was only an exchange of musty words that we had found too late. A father is
a poor estate to come into at two and twenty.

"I should have been told of this," he said.

"Your mother did right, sir," I answered slowly, but he shook his head.

"I think you have misjudged her," he said. "Doubtless while my fa- -, while Adam Dishart lived,
she could only think of you with pain; but after his death--"

"After his death," I said quietly, "I was still so horrible to her that she left Harvie without
letting a soul know whither she was bound. She dreaded my following her."

"Stranger to me," he said, after a pause, "than even your story is her being able to keep it
from me. I believed no thought ever crossed her mind that she did not let me share."

"And none, I am sure, ever did," I answered, "save that, and such thoughts as a woman has with
God only. It was my lot to bring disgrace on her. She thought it nothing less, and she has
hidden it all these years for your sake, until now it is not burdensome. I suppose she feels
that God has taken the weight off her. Now you are to put a heavier burden in its place."

He faced me boldly, and I admire him for it now.

"I cannot admit," he said, "that I did wrong in forgetting my mother for that fateful quarter
of an hour. Babbie and I loved each other, and I was given the opportunity of making her mine
or losing her forever. Have you forgotten that all this tragedy you have told me of only grew
out of your own indecision? I took the chance that you let slip by."

"I had not forgotten," I replied. "What else made me tell you last night that Babbie was in
Nanny's house?"

"But now you are afraid--now when the deed is done, when for me there can be no turning back.
Whatever be the issue, I should be a cur to return to Thrums without my wife. Every minute
I feel my strength returning, and before you reach Thrums I will have set out to the Spittal."

There was nothing to say after that. He came with me in the rain as far as the dike, warning
me against telling his people what was not true.

"My first part," I answered, "will be to send word to your mother that you are in safety. After
that I must see Whamond. Much depends on him."

"You will not go to my mother?"

"Not so long as she has a roof over her head," I said, "but that may not be for long."

So, I think, we parted--each soon to forget the other in a woman.

But I had not gone far when I heard something that stopped me as sharply as if it had been
McKenzie's hand once more on my shoulder. For a second the noise appalled me, and then, before
the echo began, I knew it must be the Spittal cannon. My only thought was one of thankfulness.
Now Gavin must see the wisdom of my reasoning. I would wait for him until he was able to come
with me to Thrums. I turned back, and in my haste I ran through water I had gone round before.

I was too late. He was gone, and into the rain I shouted his name in vain. That he had started
for the Spittal there could be no doubt; that he would ever reach it was less certain. The
earl's collie was still crouching by the fire, and, thinking it might be a guide to him, I
drove the brute to the door, and chased it in the direction he probably had taken. Not until
it had run from me did I resume my own journey. I do not need to be told that you who read
would follow Gavin now rather than me; but you must bear with the dominie for a little while
yet, as I see no other way of making things clear.

In some ways I was not ill-equipped for my attempt. I do not know any one of our hillsides
as it is known to the shepherd, to whom every rabbit-hole and glimmer of mica is a landmark;
but he, like his flock, has only to cross a dike to find himself in a strange land, while I
have been everywhere in the glen.

In the foreground the rain slanted, transparent till it reached the ground, where a mist seemed
to blow it along as wind ruffles grass. In the distance all was a driving mist. I have been
out for perhaps an hour in rains as wetting, and I have watched floods from my window, but
never since have I known the fifth part of a season's rainfall in eighteen hours; and if there
should be the like here again, we shall be found better prepared for it. Men have been lost
in the glen in mists so thick that they could plunge their fingers out of sight in it as into
a meal girnel; but this mist never came within twenty yards of me. I was surrounded by it,
however, as if I was in a round tent; and out of this tent I could not walk, for it advanced
with me. On the other side of this screen were horrible noises, at whose cause I could only
guess, save now and again when a tongue of water was shot at my feet, or great stones came
crashing through the canvas of mist. Then I ran wherever safety prompted, and thus tangled
my bearings until I was like that one in the child's game who is blindfolded and turned round
three times that he may not know east from west.

Once I stumbled over a dead sheep and a living lamb; and in a clump of trees which puzzled
me--for they were where I thought no trees should be--a wood-pigeon flew to me, but struck
my breast with such force that I picked it up dead. I saw no other living thing, though half
a dozen times I must have passed within cry of farmhouses. At one time I was in a cornfield,
where I had to lift my hands to keep them out of water, and a dread filled me that I had wandered
in a circle, and was still on Waster Lunny's land. I plucked some corn and held it to my eyes
to see if it was green; but it was yellow, and so I knew that at last I was out of the glen.

People up here will complain if I do not tell how I found the farmer of Green Brae's fifty
pounds. It is one of the best- remembered incidents of the flood, and happened shortly after
I got out of the cornfield. To the east, again, beyond and in the Argonne, the army of the
Crown Prince of Prussia was upon the point of reducing Verdun, the permanent works of which
fortress had already suffered the first days of that bombardment from the new German siege
train which had hitherto at every experiment completely destroyed the defence in a few
hours.
If we take for the terminal of this first chapter in the Great War the morning of 4th September,
we may perceive how nearly the enemy had achieved his object, to which there now stood as a
threat nothing more but the French reserves, unexpected in magnitude, though their presence
was already discovered, which had for the most part been gathered in the neighbourhood of and
behind the fortified zone of Paris.

With this position, of what it meant in immediate alternatives to the enemy, I will deal a few pages on
at the close of this book, when I will also consider in one conspectus on the map the whole
of that ten days' sweep down from the north, and summarize its effect upon the Allied attitude
towards the next phase of the war.

But to understand a campaign, one must seize not only the topographical positions of troops,
nor only their number: one must also gauge the temper of their commanders and of the political
opinion at home behind them, for upon this moral factor everything ultimately depends. The
men that fight are living men, and the motive power is the soul.

It is, therefore, necessary for the reader to appreciate at this terminal date, September 2-4,
the moral strength of the enemy, and to comprehend in what mood of confidence the Germans
now lay. With this object we must add to the story of the advance on Paris the subsidiary
events which had accompanied that great sweep into the West. We must turn to the "holding
up of Russia" upon the East by the Austrian forces, and see how the partial failure of this
effort (news of which was just reaching the Western armies) was
quite eclipsed by the splendid tidings of Tannenberg.

We must see with German eyes the secondary but brilliant victory in front of Metz; we must
stand in their shoes to feel as they did the clearing of Alsace, and to comprehend with what
contempt they must have watched the false picture of the war which the governments and the press
of the Allies, particularly in Britain, presented to public opinion in their doomed territories;
and we must, in general, grasp the now apocalyptic temper of the nervous, over-strained
industrialized population which is the tissue of modern Germany.

Not until we have a good general aspect of that mood can we understand either the war at this
turning-point in its fortunes, or the future developments which will be traced in the
succeeding volumes of this series.

I will, therefore, now turn to the three main elements productive of that mood in their
historical order: the Battle of Metz, the Austrian operations
against Russia, and, lastly, the great victory of Tannenberg in
East Prussia, before concluding this volume with a summary of the
whole situation in those first days of September, just before the
tide turned.

THE BATTLE OF METZ.

The Battle of Metz, though quite subsidiary to the general operations of the war, and upon
a scale which later operations have dwarfed, will be mentioned
with special emphasis in any just account of the great war on account
of its moral significance.

It took place before the main shock of the armies; it had no decisive effect upon the future
of the campaign; but it was of the very highest weight, informing the German mind, and
leading it into that attitude of violent exaltation on which I shall later insist in these
pages, and which largely determined all the first months of the war, with their enormous
consequences for the future. For the action in front of Metz was the first pitched battle fought
in Western Europe during our generation, and to an unexpected degree it fulfilled in its
narrow area all the dreams upon which military Germany had been
nourished for forty years.

It thrilled the whole nation with the news, at the very outset of hostilities, of a sharp and
glorious victory; it seemed a presage of far more to come. The Battle of Metz was the limited
foundation upon which was rapidly erected that triumphant mood that lasted long after the
tide had turned, and that matured, when bad blundering had lost the victory in the West,
into the unsoldierly, muddled hope that could fail to win, and yet somehow not lose, a
campaign.

We have seen that the disposition of the French armies at the moment when the shock was being
delivered through Belgium involved along the frontiers of Alsace-Lorraine the presence of
considerable forces. These, once the operative corner had taken the shock, formed part of
the mass of manoeuvre, and were destined in large part to swing up in aid of the men retreating
from the Sambre.

But in the very first days of the war, before the main blow had
fallen, and when the French General Staff were still in doubt as
to precisely where the blow _would_ fall, considerable bodies had
been operating in Alsace and over the Lorraine frontier.

The whole range of the Vosges was carried in the second week after
the British declaration of war--that is, between 10th August and
15th August.

Mulhouse was occupied; upon Monday, the 17th of August, Saarburg,
the most important railway junction between Strassburg and Metz,
was in French hands.

Up to that date, though such comparatively small forces were involved,
the French had possessed a very decisive numerical superiority.

It was not destined to last, for there was moving down from the
north the now mobilized strength of Germany in this region; and a
blow struck against the French left, with no less than four army
corps, was speedily to decide the issue upon this subsidiary front.

[Illustration: Sketch 66.]

This great force was based upon Metz, from which fortress the action
will presumably take its name in history.

It stretched upon the 20th of August from the north of Pont-à-Mousson to beyond Château Salins.
Before this overwhelming advance the French left rapidly retired.

 It did not retire quickly enough, and one portion of the French
force--it is believed the 15th Division (that is, the first division
of the 15th Army Corps)--failed in its task of supporting the shock.

Details of the action are wholly lacking. We depend even for what may be said at this date
upon little more than rumour. The Germans claimed a capture of ten batteries and of the
equivalent of as many battalions, and many colours. Upon the 21st the whole French left fell
back, carrying with them as a necessary consequence the centre in the Vosges Mountains and the
right upon the plains of Alsace.

So rapid was the retreat that upon the 22nd of August the Bavarians were at Lunéville, and
marching on Nancy; the extreme right of the German line had come within range of the forts
north of Toul; and in those same hours during which, on that same
Saturday, the 22nd of August, the 5th French Army in the north fell
back at the news of Namur and lost the Sambre, those forces on the
borders of Alsace-Lorraine had lost all the first advantages of
their thrust into the lost provinces, had suffered defeat in the
first striking action of the war, and had put Nancy in peril.

Nancy itself was saved. The French counter-offensive was organized on the 23rd of August, at
a moment when the German line lay from St.

Dié northwards and westwards up to positions just in front of Nancy.

It was delivered about a week later.

That counter-offensive which ultimately saved Nancy belongs to the next volume, for it did
not develop its strength until after Sedan Day, and after the end of the great sweep on
Paris.

The situation, then, in this field (the very names of which have such great moral effects upon
the French and the German minds) was, by the 2nd of September, as follows:--
The French had suffered in the first considerable action of the war
a disaster.

They had lost their foothold in the annexed provinces. They had put the capital of French Lorraine,
Nancy, in instant peril.

They had fallen back from the Vosges. They were beginning, with grave doubts of its success,
a counter-offensive, to keep the enemy, if possible, from entering Nancy. They had lost thousands
of men, many colours, and scores of guns, and all Germany was full of the news.

LEMBERG.

The foundation of the Germanic plan upon the Eastern front at the origin of the war was, as
we have said, the holding up of Russia during her necessarily slow
mobilization, while the decisive stroke was delivered in the West.

That is the largest view of the matter.

In more detail, we know that the main part of this task was entrusted to the Austro-Hungarian
forces.

The German forces had indeed entered and occupied the west fringe of Russian Poland, seizing
the small industrial belt which lies immediately east of Silesia, and the two towns of
Czestochowa and Kalish--the latter, in the very centre of the bend
of the frontier, because it was a big railway depot, and, as it
were, a gage of invasion; the former, both because the holding of
one line demanded it (if Kalish and the industrial portion were
held), and because Czestochowa being the principal shrine of the
Poles, some strange notion may have passed through the German mind
that the presence therein of Prussian officers would cajole the
Poles into an action against Russia.

If this were part of the motive (and probably it was), it would be
a parallel to many another irony in the present campaign and its
preliminaries, proceeding from the incapacity of the enemy to gauge
the subtler and more profound forces of a civilization to which it
is a stranger.

[Illustration: Sketch 67.]
This local German move was almost entirely political.

The main task, as I have said, was left to the Austrians farther south; and, proceeding to
further detail, we must see the Austrians stretched in a line from near the middle Carpathians
past the neighbourhood of Tomasow towards Tarnow, and this line
distinctly divided into two armies, a northern and a southern.

The two met in an angle in front of the great fortress of Przemysl. The northern, or first, army
faced, as will be seen, directly towards the Russian frontier.

It was the operative wing; upon its immediate action and on the
rapidity of the blow it was to deliver depended the success of this
first chapter in the Eastern war.

[Illustration: Sketch 68.]

The southern, or second, army, which stretched all along the Galician plain at the foot of the
Carpathians to the town of Halicz, had for its mission the protection of the first army from
the south. It was known, or expected, that the first army would advance right into Russian
Poland, with but inferior forces in front of it.

It was feared, however, that the main Russian concentration to the south-east of it might
turn its right flank. The business of the second army was to prevent this. The first army (I),
being the operative body, was more homogeneous in race, more picked in material than the second
(II), the latter containing many elements from the southern parts of the empire, including
perhaps not a few disaffected contingents, such as certain regiments of Italian origin from
the Adriatic border.

So far as we can judge, perhaps--and it is a very rough estimate--we
may put the whole body which Austria-Hungary was thus moving in the
first phase of the war beyond the Carpathians at more than 750,000,
but less than 1,000,000 men.

Call the mass 800,000, and one would not be far wrong. Of this mass quite a quarter lay in reserve
near the mountains behind the first army.

The remaining three-quarters, or 600,000 men, were fairly evenly
divided between the two groups of the first and of the second
army--the first, or northern, one being under the command of Dankl,
the second under that of von Auffenberg.

Each of these forces was based upon one group of depots of particular importance, the northern
operative army (I) relying upon Przemysl, and the southern one
(II) upon Lemberg.

It was less than a week after the first German advance bodies had taken the outer forts of
Liége when Dankl crossed the frontier, heading, with his centre, towards Krosnik and farther
towards Lublin. His troops were in Russian territory upon the Monday evening or the Tuesday,
10th-11th August.

The second army meanwhile stood fulfilling its rôle of awaiting and containing any Russians that
might strike in upon the south.

It had advanced no more than watching bodies towards the frontier,
such as the 35th Regiment of the Austrian Landwehr, which occupied
Sokal, and smaller units cordonned out southward between that town
and Brody.

Here, at the outset of the large operations that were to follow,
it is important for the reader to note that everything depended
upon the resisting power of the second, or southern, army.

Observe the problem. Two men, a left-hand man and a right-hand man, go out to engage two other
men whom they hope and believe to be unready.

The left-hand man is particularly confident of being able to drive
back his opponent, but he knows that sooner or later upon his right
the second enemy, a stronger man, may come in and disturb his action.

He says therefore to his right-hand companion: "Stand firm and engage and contain the energy
of your opponent until I have finished with mine.

When I have done that, I shall turn round towards you, and between us we will finish the second
man."

Seeing the paucity of Russian communications, and the physical necessity under which the Russians
were, on account of the position of their depots and centres of
mobilization, of first putting the mass of their men on the south,
the physical impossibility under which they lay of putting the mass
of their men in the north for the moment, the plan was a sound one;
_but_ its success depended entirely upon the tenacity of the second
Austrian army, which would have to meet large, and might have to
meet superior, numbers.

The first army went forward with very little loss and against very little resistance. The
Russian forces which were against it, which we may call the first
Russian army, were inferior in number, and fell back, though not
rapidly, towards the Bug.

It relied to some extent in this movement upon the protection afforded by the forts of Zamosc,
but it was never in any serious danger until, or unless, things went wrong in the south. The
Austrians remained in contact (but no more), turned somewhat eastward in order to keep hold
of the foe, when their advance was checked by the news, first of unexpected Russian strength,
later of overwhelming Russian advances towards the south. Long before the third week in August,
the first Austrian army was compelled to check its advance upon
the news reaching it from the second, and its fortunes, in what it
had intended to be a successful invasion of Russian Poland, had
ended.

For the whole meaning of the first Galician campaign turns after the 14th of August upon the
great Russian advance in the south.

It was upon that day, August 14, that the Russian force, under General Russky (which we will call
the second army), crossed the frontier. Its right occupied Sokal, its centre left moved in
line with the right upon von Auffenberg's force directly before it.

The Russian mobilization had proceeded at a greater pace than the enemy had allowed for. The
Russian numbers expected in this field appeared in far greater
strength than this expectation had allowed for, and it was soon
apparent that von Auffenberg's command would have to resist very
heavy pressure.

But it would be an error to imagine, as was too hastily concluded
in the press of Western Europe at the time, that this pressure upon
the front of the second Austrian army, with its dogged day after
day fighting and mile by mile advance, was the principal deciding
factor in the issue.

That deciding factor was, in fact, the appearance upon the right flank of von Auffenberg of
yet another Russian army (which we will call the third) under Brussilov. It was the menace of
this force, unexpected, or at least unexpected in its great strength, which really determined
the issue, though this was again affected by the tardiness of the
Austrian retirement.

Russky's direct advance upon the front of his enemy extended for a week. It had begun when
it had destroyed the frontier posts upon Friday, the 14th.

It was continued until the evening of the succeeding Thursday, regularly, slowly, but without
intermission. It stood upon the Friday, the 21st--the day on which the first shots were fired
at the main Franco-British forces in the West, and the day on which
the first shell fell into Charleroi station--not more than one day's
cavalry advance from the outer works of Lemberg, but it was just
in that week-end that the pressure of Brussilov began to be felt.

This third Russian army had come up from the south-east, supplied
by the main Odessa railway through Tarnopol.

It was manifestly threatening the right flank of von Auffenberg,
and if a guess may be hazarded upon operations on which we have so
little detail as yet, and which took place so far from our own
standpoint, the error of the Austrian general seems to have consisted
in believing that he could maintain himself against this flank
attack.

If this were the case (and it is the most probable explanation of
what followed), the error would have been due to the same cause
which affected all Austrian plans in these first days of the war--the
mistake as to the rapidity with which Russia would complete her
preparations.

[Illustration: Sketch 69.]
The first outpost actions with the enemy, and even the more vigorous
struggles when full contact had been established with this third
army arrived thus from the south-east, only led the Austrian commander
deeper into his mistaken calculation; for upon the Sunday, August
23rd, a local success was achieved which seems to be magnified by
the Austrians into a decisive check administered to the enemy.

If this was their view, they were soon to be undeceived.

In those very days which saw the greatest peril in the West, the last days of August, during
which the Franco-British Allies were falling back from the Sambre, pursued by the numbers
we have seen upon an earlier page, the third and the second Russian
armies effected their junction, the moment of their first joining
hands being apparently that same Monday, the 24th of August, during
which Sir John French was falling back upon Maubeuge.

By the middle of the ensuing week they had already advanced with a
very heavy numerical superiority upon the part of the Russians,
which threatened to involve the Austrian second army in disaster.

If that went, the first army was at the mercy of the victors upon the south, and with every day
that passed the chance of collapse increased.

Now, too late (so far as we can judge), the second Austrian army disposed itself for retreat,
but that retreat was not allowed to proceed in the orderly fashion
which its commander had decided, and in the event part of it turned
into a rout, all of it developed into a definite disaster for the
enemy, and as conspicuous a success for our ally.

He tried to get in last nicht, and roared threats through the
door, and after he had gone awa she speired wha I had been speaking to. I had to tell her,
but I said he had come to let her ken that the minister was taking shelter frae the rain in
a farmhouse. Ay, I said he was to bide there till the flood gaed down, and that's how she has
been easy a day. I acted for the best, but I'm sair punished now; for when she heard Tammas
at the door twa or three minutes syne, she ordered me to let him in, so that she could thank
him for bringing--the news last nicht, despite the rain. They're in the parlor. Oh, dominie,
gang in and stop his mouth."

This was hard. I dared not go to the parlor. Margaret might have died at sight of me. I turned
my face from Jean.

"Jean," said some one, opening the inner kitchen door, "why did you--?"

She stopped, and that was what turned me round. As she spoke I thought it was the young lady;
when I looked I saw it was Babbie, though no longer in a gypsy's dress. Then I knew that the
young lady and Babbie were one.

 HOW BABBIE SPENT THE NIGHT OF AUGUST FOURTH.

How had the Egyptian been spirited here from the Spittal? I did not ask the question. To interest
myself in Babbie at that dire hour of Margaret's life would have been as impossible to me as
to sit down to a book. To others, however, it is only an old woman on whom the parlor door
of the manse has closed, only a garrulous dominie that is in pain outside it. Your eyes are
on the young wife.

When Babbie was plucked off the hill, she thought as little as Gavin that her captor was Rob
Dow. Close as he was to her, he was but a shadow until she screamed the second time, when he
pressed her to the ground and tied his neckerchief over her mouth. Then, in the moment that
power of utterance was taken from her, she saw the face that had startled her at Nanny's window.
Half-carried, she was borne forward rapidly, until some one seemed to rise out of the broom
and strike them both. They had only run against the doctor's trap; and huddling her into it,
Dow jumped up beside her. He tied her hands together with a cord. For a time the horse feared
the darkness in front more than the lash behind; but when the rains became terrific, it rushed
ahead wildly--probably with its eyes shut.

In three minutes Babbie went through all the degrees of fear. In the first she thought Lord
Rintoul had kidnapped her; but no sooner had her captor resolved himself into Dow, drunk with
the events of the day and night, than in the earl's hands would have lain safety. Next, Dow
was forgotten in the dread of a sudden death which he must share. And lastly, the rain seemed
to be driving all other horrors back, that it might have her for its own. Her perils increased
to the unbearable as quickly as an iron in the fire passes through the various stages between
warmth and white heat. Then she had to do something; and as she could not cry out, she flung
herself from the dogcart. She fell heavily in Caddani Wood, but the rain would not let her
lie there stunned. It beat her back to consciousness, and she sat up on her knees and listened
breathlessly, staring in the direction the trap had taken, as if her eyes could help her ears.

All night, I have said, the rain poured, but those charges only rode down the deluge at intervals,
as now and again one wave greater than the others stalks over the sea. In the first lull it
appeared to Babbie that the storm had swept by, leaving her to Dow. Now she heard the rubbing
of the branches, and felt the torn leaves falling on her gown. She rose to feel her way out
of the wood with her bound hands, then sank in terror, for some one had called her name. Next
moment she was up again, for the voice was Gavin's, who was hurrying after her, as he thought,
down Windyghoul. He was no farther away than a whisper might have carried on a still night,
but she dared not pursue him, for already Dow was coming back. She could not see him, but she
heard the horse whinny and the rocking of the dogcart. Dow was now at the brute's head, and
probably it tried to bite him, for he struck it, crying:

"Would you? Stand still till I find her. I heard her move this minute."

Babbie crouched upon a big stone and sat motionless while he groped for her. Her breathing
might have been tied now, as well as her mouth. She heard him feeling for her, first with his
feet and then with his hands, and swearing when his head struck against a tree.

"I ken you're within hearing," he muttered, "and I'll hae you yet. I have a gully-knife in
my hand. Listen!"

He severed a whin-stalk with the knife, and Babbie seemed to see the gleam of the blade.

"What do I mean by wanting to kill you?" he said, as if she had asked the question. "Do you
no ken wha said to me, 'Kill this woman?' It was the Lord. 'I winna kill her,' I said, 'but
I'll cart her out o' the country.' 'Kill her,' says He; 'why encumbereth she the ground?'"

He resumed his search, but with new tactics. "I see you now," he would cry, and rush forward
perhaps within a yard of her. Then she must have screamed had she had the power. When he tied
that neckerchief round her mouth he prolonged her life.

Then came the second hurricane of rain, so appalling that had Babbie's hands been free she
would have pressed them to her ears. For a full minute she forgot Dow's presence. A living
thing touched her face. The horse had found her. She recoiled from it, but its frightened head
pressed heavily on her shoulder. She rose and tried to steal away, but the brute followed,
and as the rain suddenly exhausted itself she heard the dragging of the dogcart. She had to halt.

Again she heard Dow's voice. Perhaps he had been speaking throughout the roar of the rain.
If so, it must have made him deaf to his own words. He groped for the horse's head, and presently
his hand touched Babbie's dress, then jumped from it, so suddenly had he found her. No sound
escaped him, and she was beginning to think it possible that he had mistaken her for a bush
when his hand went over her face. He was making sure of his discovery.

"The Lord has delivered you into my hands," he said in a low voice, with some awe in it. Then
he pulled her to the ground, and, sitting down beside her, rocked himself backward and forward,
his hands round his knees. She would have bartered the world for power to speak to him.

"He wouldna hear o' my just carting you to some other countryside," he said confidentially.
"'The devil would just blaw her back again, says He, 'therefore kill her.' 'And if I kill her,'
I says, 'they'll hang me.' 'You can hang yoursel',' says He. 'What wi'?' I speirs. 'Wi' the
reins o' the dogcart,' says He. 'They would break,' says I. 'Weel, weel,' says He, 'though
they do hang you, nobody'll miss you.' 'That's true,' says I, 'and You are a just God.'"

The mass of the reserve in France is so great that the movements
of the precious metals, when they are the result only of natural
causes, are allowed to go on without corresponding movements in the
discount rate.

But it must be remembered that this large reserve is held in part against a gigantic note issue, and
also that the trade activity and enterprise of the French people
are less intense than in either the United Kingdom or Germany; thus
it is much easier for the Bank of France to maintain a steady rate
of discount.

Besides the Bank of France, several great credit institutions carry
on business in the country; as the _Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas_
(capital and reserve, £3,729,000; other liabilities, deposits, &c.,
£14,842,000), the _Banque Française pour le Commerce et l'Industrie_
(£2,450,000; and £3,505,000), the _Crédit Lyonnais_ (£14,000,000;
and £82,570,000), the _Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris_
(£6,772,000; and £47,593,000), the _Société Générale pour favoriser
le développement du Commerce et de l'Industrie en France_ (£7,469,000;
and £45,800,000), and the _Société Générale de Crédit Industriel
et Commercial_ (£1,600,000; and £10,060,000).

There is also the _Crédit Foncier de France_ with a very considerable capital, but the
business done is so largely that of mortgages that it can hardly be included among banks,
though it carries on in some measure the business of banking.

Besides the six important joint-stock banks mentioned above, there
exists in France a large number of banks, principally in the
provinces, carrying on a very considerable business.

Little is known as to their deposits, but their business appears to be conducted with great
prudence and discretion.

One hundred and eighty-two of these firms were members of the French
Country Bankers' Association in 1898.

They carry on business in 66 out of the 86 departments into which France is divided. More than
one of these banks has several offices--one possessing 18, including the head office. These
branches are situated in the small towns in the vicinity.

In this the business follows more the English method of small branches. The French Country
Bankers' Association holds its meetings in Paris, where matters of interest to bankers are
discussed. (See _Bankers' Magazine_, July 1898.)
_Germany_.--Besides the Imperial Bank of Germany, the "Reichsbank," there are about 140 banks
doing business in the states which form the German empire. These credit and industrial banks
with their large resources have had an immense influence in bringing about the astonishing
industrial development of their country. Five banks possess the right of uncovered note-issue;
these are:--

The Imperial Bank of Germany with right of issue £23,641,450 The Bank of Saxony " " " 838,500
The Bank of Bavaria " " " 1,600,000 The Bank of Württemberg " " " 500,000 The Bank of Baden "
" " 500,000 ----------- £27,079,950
At the Bank of Germany the coin and bullion held is sometimes larger
than at the Bank of England.

The statement of the specie in the weekly accounts includes silver. The amounts held in gold
and silver are only separated once a year, when the balance-sheet
is published.

The figures of the balance-sheet for the 31st of December 1906
showed in round numbers £24,000,000 gold and £9,000,000 silver.

As far as the capital is concerned the £18,000,000 of the Bank of England considerably exceeds
the £9,000,000 of the Bank of France and the £12,200,000 of the
Bank of Germany.

The note circulation of both the other banks is considerably larger
than that of the Bank of England, that of the Bank of France being
£186,300,000, and of the Imperial Bank of Germany £69,000,000 in
1906.

The capitals and reserves of the German banks, including those of banks established to do
business in other countries, as South America and the Far East, and of the Bank of Germany,
are about £133,000,000, with further resources, including deposits, notes and mortgage bonds,
amounting to fully £414,000,000. The amount of the capital compares very closely with that of
the capitals of the banks of the United Kingdom. The deposits are increasing. The deposits,
however, are not the whole of the resources of the German banks. The banks make use, besides,
of their acceptances in a manner which is not practised by the
banks of other countries, and the average note circulation of the
Reichsbank, included in the statement given above, is between
£60,000,000 and £70,000,000.

A large and apparently increasing proportion of the resources of the German banks is employed
in industrial concerns, some of which are beyond the boundaries of the empire. The dangers
of this practice have called forth many criticisms in Germany, among which may be quoted the
remarks of Caesar Strauss and of Dr R. Koch, the president of the Reichsbank. Dr Koch especially
points out the need of the development of powerful banks in Germany unconnected with speculative
business of this kind. The object of employing their funds thus is the higher rate of interest
to be obtained from these investments than from discounting bills or making loans at home.

But such an employment of the resources of a bank is opposed to all regular rules of business
and of banking tradition, which abstains from making fixed investments
of any large part of the resources of a bank.

On the other hand, Dr Koch observes that the risks of the one
"reserve system" mentioned by Bagehot are not to be feared in
Germany.[5] The recent movement in favour of concentration among
the banks has been described by Dr E.

Depitre and Dr Riesser, who give particulars of the business done by these banks, which does
not correspond with banking as practised in the United Kingdom,
being more of an industrial character.

There are also many private banking firms in Germany which do a
considerable amount of business.

The Reichsbank, by far the most powerful banking institution in
Germany, is managed by the bank directory appointed by the chancellor
of the empire.

The shareholders join in the management through a committee, of which each member must be
qualified by holding not less than three shares. The government exercises complete powers
of control through the chancellor of the empire.
The influence of the Imperial Bank now permeates, by means of its branches, all the separate
kingdoms of the empire--the uniformity of coinage introduced through the laws of 1871-1873
rendering this possible. The Imperial Bank assists business principally in two ways--first,
through the clearing system (_Giro-Verkehr_), which it has greatly developed, and secondly,
through the facilities given to business by its note circulation.

The Imperial Bank also receives deposits, and cheques are drawn against these, but in Germany
notes are principally used in payments for ordinary business.

Before the Reichsbank was established, Hamburg was the first, and for a long time the only,
example of a clearing in Germany. This was taken up by the Reichsbank when it established its office
in Hamburg in the time-honoured building which had belonged to the Hamburg Clearing House.
Similar business had long been undertaken by the Bank of Prussia.

This was absorbed and developed by the Reichsbank in 1876. Through the "clearing system" money
can be remitted from any of the 443 places in which there is an office of the Reichsbank, to
any of these places, without charge either to the sender or the receiver. It is sufficient
that the person to whom the money is to be remitted should have an account at the bank. Any
person owing him money in the remotest parts of the empire may go
to the office of the bank which is most convenient to him and pay
in the amount of his debt, which is credited on the following day
at the office of the bank, without charge, to the account of his
creditor wherever he may reside.

The person who makes the payment need not have any account with the
bank.

The impetus given to business by this arrangement has been very
considerable.

It practically amounts to a money-order system without charge or
risk of loss in transmission.

From Hamburg and Bremen to the frontiers of Russia, from the shores
of the Baltic to the frontiers of Switzerland, the whole of the
empire of Germany has thus become for monetary purposes one country
only.

The amount of these transfers for the year 1906 exceeded
£1,860,000,000.

The note circulation is also a powerful factor of the business of
the Reichsbank.

It is governed by the law of 1875 and the amending law of 1899,
corresponding in some degree to Peel's act of 1844, which regulates
the note circulation of the Bank of England.

An uncovered limit, originally £12,500,000, increased to £14,811,450 by the lapse of the issues
of other banks allowed to it, has been extended by these and by
the act of the 5th of June 1902 to £23,641,450.

Against the notes thus issued which are not represented by specie,
treasury notes (_Reichskassenscheine_, the legal tender notes of
the [v.03 p.0344] empire)[6] and notes of the issuing banks which
are allowed to be reckoned as specie or discounted bills, must be
held--maturing not later than three months after being taken--with,
as a rule, three, but never less than two, good indorsements.

There is also a provision that at least one-third of the notes in
circulation must be covered by current German notes, money, notes
of the imperial treasury, and gold in bullion or foreign coin
reckoned at £69, 12s. per pound fine.

The Reichsbank is bound by law to redeem its notes in current German money. It is stated that
this may be gold coin or silver thalers, or bar-gold at the rate of 1392 marks (£69, 12s.
reckoning marks as 20 = £1) the pound fine of gold.

In practice, however, facilities have not always been given by the
Reichsbank for the payment of its obligations in gold, though the
importance of this is admitted.

In the balance-sheet for 1906 the bills held amounted to £67,000,000, and the loans and advances
to £14,200,000.

The notes issued averaged for the year £69,000,000. The gold held amounted, 30th December 1906,
to £24,069,000. If the condition of business requires that the notes in circulation should
exceed the limits allowed by the law, the bank is permitted to do
this on the payment of 5% on the surplus.

In this respect the German act differs from the English act, which
allows no such automatic statutory power of overpassing the limit
of issue.

Some good authorities consider that this arrangement is an advantage
for the German bank, and the fact that it has been made use of
annually since 1895 appears to show that it is needed by the business
requirements of the country.

Of late years the excess of issue of the Reichsbank has been annual
and large, having been £25,267,000 on the 29th of September 1906
and £28,632,000 on the 31st of December of the same year.

The amount of the duty paid on the excess issue in the year 1906
was £184,764, and the total amount paid thus from 1876 to 1906 was
£839,052.

The increase of the uncovered limit (untaxed limit of issue called
in Germany the "note reserve") has not been sufficient to obviate
the need for an excess of issue beyond the limit.

In accordance with a law passed in 1906 the Imperial Bank issues
notes (_Reichsbanknoten_) of the value of 20 marks (£1), and 50
marks (£2, 10s.) in addition to the 5, 10, 100 and 1000 mark notes
(5s., 10s., £5, £50) previously in circulation.

Imperial paper currency of the value of 20 or 50 marks (£1 and £2,
10s.) had previously existed only in the form of treasury notes
(_Reichskassenscheine_); these will in consequence be withdrawn
from circulation.

The amendment of the banking law of Germany, passed in 1899, not
only affects the position of the Reichsbank, but that of the four
other note-issuing banks.

The capital of the Reichsbank has been raised by the bill of that
year to £9,000,000.

The reserve fund has been raised out of surplus profits to £3,240,000. This exceeds the amount
required by the act of 1899, which was £3,000,000.

The amending act further diminishes the dividend receivable by the
stockholders of the Reichsbank and increases the share which the
government will obtain.

The arrangement with the four note-issuing banks is designed to
cause them to work in harmony with the Reichsbank when the Reichsbank
has to raise its bank-rate in order to protect its gold reserves.

The official published rate of discount of the Reichsbank is to be binding on the private
note-issuing banks after it has reached or when it reaches 4%. At other times they are not
to discount at more than ¼% below the official rate of the Reichsbank,
or in case the Reichsbank itself discounts at a lower rate than the
official rate, at more than 1/8% below that rate.

If the Reichsbank discounts below the official rate, it is to
announce that fact in the _Gazette_.

The subject being important, we quote from the amending act the sections governing the discount
rate:--_Gesetz, betreffend die Abänderung des Bankgesetzes vom 14.

März 1875; vom 7. Juni 1899, Artikel 7, S. 1_.

The private note-issuing banks are bound by _Artikel 7, S. 2_, after
the 1st of January 1901:--"(1) Not to discount below the rate
published in S. 15 of the bank law, so long as this rate attains
or exceeds 4%, and (2) moreover, not to discount at more than ¼%
below the Reichsbank rate, published in S. 15 of the bank law, or
in case the Reichsbank itself discounts at a lower rate, not to
discount at more than 1/8% below that rate."

It remains to be seen whether the note-issuing banks will find these
conditions too onerous, and rather than be bound by them will give
up their right of issuing notes.

The object of the enactment is apparently to protect the specie
reserve of the Reichsbank, but it may be doubted whether, considering
the importance of the other banks of Germany--none of which is bound
by similar conditions--relatively to the note-issuing banks, the
restrictions put on the note-issuing banks will have any practical
effect.

Since 1870 banking has made immense progress in Germany, but it may be some time before the
habit of making payments by cheque instead of specie or notes becomes general.

"So it seems; but I will drag him into the light, wherever he is skulking."

Lord Rintoul strode to the door, and the brake was off his tongue already.

"Go," said Babbie coldly, "and shout and stamp through the house; you may succeed in frightening
the women, who are the only persons in it."

"Where is he?"

"He has gone to the Spittal to see you."

"He knew I was on the hill."

"He lost me in the darkness, and thought you had run away with me in your trap."

"Ha! So he is off to the Spittal to ask me to give you back to him."

"To compel you," corrected Babbie.

"Pooh!" said the earl nervously, "that was but mummery on the hill."

"It was a marriage."

"With gypsies for witnesses. Their word would count for less than nothing. Babbie, I am still
in time to save you."

"I don't want to be saved. The marriage had witnesses no court could discredit."

"What witnesses?"

"Mr. McKenzie and yourself."

She heard his teeth meet. When next she looked at him, there were tears in his eyes as well
as in her own. It was perhaps the first time these two had, ever been in close sympathy. Both
were grieving for Rintoul.

"I am so sorry," Babbie began in a broken voice; then stopped, because they seemed such feeble
words.

"If you are sorry," the earl answered eagerly, "it is not yet too late. McKenzie and I saw
nothing. Come away with me, Babbie, if only in pity for yourself."

"Ah, but I don't pity myself."

"Because this man has blinded you."

"No, he has made me see."

"This mummery on the hill--"

"Why do you call it so? I believe God approved of that marriage, as He could never have countenanced
yours and mine."

"God! I never heard the word on your lips before."

"I know that."

"It is his teaching, doubtless?"

"Yes."

"And he told you that to do to me as you have done was to be pleasing in God's sight?"

"No; he knows that it was so evil in God's sight that I shall suffer for it always."

"But he has done no wrong, so there is no punishment for him?"

"It is true that he has done no wrong, but his punishment will be worse, probably, than mine."

"That," said the earl, scoffing, "is not just."

"It is just. He has accepted responsibility for my sins by marrying me."

"And what form is his punishment to take?"

"For marrying me he will be driven from his church and dishonored in all men's eyes, unless--unless
God is more merciful to us than we can expect."

Her sincerity was so obvious that the earl could no longer meet it with sarcasm.

"It is you I pity now," he said, looking wonderingly at her. "Do you not see that this man
has deceived you? Where was his boasted purity in meeting you by stealth, as he must have been
doing, and plotting to take you from me?"

"If you knew him," Babbie answered, "you would not need to be told that he is incapable of
that. He thought me an ordinary gypsy until an hour ago."

"And you had so little regard for me that you waited until the eve of what was to be our marriage,
and then, laughing at my shame, ran off to marry him."

"I am not so bad as that," Babbie answered, and told him what had brought her to Thrums. "I
had no thought but of returning to you, nor he of keeping me from you. We had said good-by
at the mudhouse door--and then we heard your voice."

"And my voice was so horrible to you that it drove you to this?"

"I--I love him so much."

What more could Babbie answer? These words told him that, if love commands, home, the friendships
of a lifetime, kindnesses incalculable, are at once as naught. Nothing is so cruel as love
if a rival challenges it to combat.

"Why could you not love me, Babbie?" said the earl sadly. "I have done so much for you."

It was little he had done for her that was not selfish. Men are deceived curiously in such
matters. When, they add a new wing to their house, they do not call the action virtue; but
if they give to a fellow-creature for their own gratification, they demand of God a good mark
for it. Babbie, however, was in no mood to make light of the earl's gifts, and at his question
she shook her head sorrowfully.

"Is it because I am too--old?"

This was the only time he ever spoke of his age to her.

"Oh no, it is not that," she replied hastily, "I love Mr. Dishart- -because he loves me, I think."

"Have I not loved you always?"

"Never," Babbie answered simply. "If you had, perhaps then I should have loved you."

"Babbie," he exclaimed, "if ever man loved woman, and showed it by the sacrifices he made for
her, I--"

"No," Babbie said, "you don't understand what it is. Ah! I did not mean to hurt you."

"If I don't know what it is, what is it?" he asked, almost humbly. "I scarcely know you now."

"That is it," said Babbie.

She gave him back his ring, and then he broke down pitifully. Doubtless there was good in him,
but I saw him only once; and with nothing to contrast against it, I may not now attempt to
breathe life into the dust of his senile passion. These were the last words that passed between
him and Babbie:

"There was nothing," he said wistfully, "in this wide world that you could not have had by
asking me for it. Was not that love?"

"No," she answered. "What right have I to everything I cry for?"

"You should never have had a care had you married me. That is love."

"It is not. I want to share my husband's cares, as I expect him to share mine."

"I would have humored you in everything."

"You always did: as if a woman's mind were for laughing at, like a baby's passions."

"You had your passions, too, Babbie. Yet did I ever chide you for them? That was love."

"No, it was contempt. Oh," she cried passionately, "what have not you men to answer for who
talk of love to a woman when her face is all you know of her; and her passions, her aspirations,
are for kissing to sleep, her very soul a plaything? I tell you, Lord Rintoul, and it is all
the message I send back to the gentlemen at the Spittal who made love to me behind your back,
that this is a poor folly, and well calculated to rouse the wrath of God."

Now, Jean's ear had been to the parlor keyhole for a time, but some message she had to take
to Margaret, and what she risked saying was this:

"It's Lord Rintoul and a party that has been catched in the rain, and he would be obliged to
you if you could gie his bride shelter for the nicht."

Thus the distracted servant thought to keep Margaret's mind at rest until Gavin came back.

"Lord Rintoul!" exclaimed Margaret. "What a pity Gavin has missed him. Of course she can stay
here. Did you say I bad gone to bed? I should not know What to say to a lord. But ask her to
come up to me after he has gone--and, Jean, is the parlor looking tidy?"

Lord Rintoul having departed, Jean told Babbie how she had accounted to Margaret for his visit.
"And she telled me to gie you dry claethes and her compliments, and would you gang up to the
bedroom and see her?"

Very slowly Babbie climbed the stairs. I suppose she is the only person who was ever afraid
of Margaret. Her first knock on the bedroom door was so soft that Margaret, who was sitting
up in bed, did not hear it. When Babbie entered the room, Margaret's first thought was that
there could be no other so beautiful as this, and her second was that the stranger seemed even
more timid than herself. After a few minutes' talk she laid aside her primness, a weapon she
had drawn in self-defence lest this fine lady should not understand the grandeur of a manse,
and at a "Call me Babbie, won't you?" she smiled.

"That is what some other person calls you," said Margaret archly. "Do you know that he took
twenty minutes to say good-night? My dear," she added hastily, misinterpreting Babbie's silence,
"I should have been sorry had he taken one second less. Every tick of the clock was a gossip,
telling me how he loves you."

In the dim light a face that begged for pity was turned to Margaret.

"He does love you, Babbie?" she asked, suddenly doubtful.

Babbie turned away her face, then shook her head.

"But you love him?"

Again Babbie shook her head.

"Oh, my dear," cried Margaret, in distress, "if this is so, are you not afraid to marry him?"

She knew now that Babbie was crying, but she did not know why Babbie could not look her in
the face.

"There may be times," Babbie said, most woeful that she had not married Rintoul, "when it is
best to marry a man though we do not love him."

"You are wrong, Babbie," Margaret answered gravely; "if I know anything at all, it is that."

"It may be best for others."

"Do you mean for one other?" Margaret asked, and the girl bowed her head. "Ah, Babbie, you
speak like a child."

"You do not understand."

"I do not need to be told the circumstances to know this--that if two people love each other,
neither has any right to give the other up."

Babbie turned impulsively to cast herself on the mercy of Gavin's mother, but no word could
she say; a hot tear fell from her eyes "upon the coverlet, and then she looked at the door,
as if to run away.

"But I have been too inquisitive," Margaret began; whereupon Babbie cried, "Oh no, no, no:
you are very good. I have no one who cares whether I do right or wrong."

"Your parents--"

"I have had none since I was a child."

"It is the more reason why I should be your friend," Margaret said, taking the girl's hand.

"You do not know what you are saying. You cannot be my friend."

"Yes, dear, I love you already. You have a good face, Babbie, as well as a beautiful one."

Babbie could remain in the room no longer. She bade Margaret good- night and bent forward to
kiss her; then drew back, like a Judas ashamed.

"Why did you not kiss me?" Margaret asked in surprise, but poor Babbie walked out of the room
without answering.

Of what occurred at the manse on the following day until I reached it, I need tell little more.
When Babbie was tending Sam'l Farquharson's child in the Tenements she learned of the flood
in Glen Quharity, and that the greater part of the congregation had set off to the assistance
of the farmers; but fearful as this made her for Gavin's safety, she kept the new anxiety from
his mother. Deceived by another story of Jean's, Margaret was the one happy person in the house.

"I believe you had only a lover's quarrel with Lord Rintoul last night," she said to Babbie
in the afternoon. "Ah, you see I can guess what is taking you to the window so often. You must
not think him long in coming for you. I can assure you that the rain which keeps my son from
me must be sufficiently severe to separate even true lovers. Take an old woman's example, Babbie.
If I thought the minister's absence alarming, I should be in anguish; but as it is, my mind
is so much at ease that, see, I can thread my needle."

It was in less than an hour after Margaret spoke thus tranquilly to Babbie that the precentor
got into the manse.

CHAPTER XLII.

MARGARET, THE PRECENTOR. AND GOD BETWEEN.

Unless Andrew Luke, who went to Canadas be still above ground, I am now the only survivor of
the few to whom Lang Tammas told what passed in the manse parlor after the door closed on him
and Margaret. With the years the others lost the details, but before I forget them the man
who has been struck by lightning will look at his arm without remembering what shrivelled it.
There even came a time when the scene seemed more vivid to me than to the precentor, though
that was only after he began to break up.

"She was never the kind o' woman," Whamond said, "that a body need be nane feared at. You can
see she is o' the timid sort. I couldna hae selected a woman easier to speak bold out to, though
I had ha'en my pick o' them."

He was a gaunt man, sour and hard, and he often paused in his story with a puzzled look on
his forbidding face.

"But, man, she was so michty windy o' him. If he had wanted to put a knife into her, I believe
that woman would just hae telled him to take care no to cut his hands. Ay, and what innocent-like
she was! If she had heard enough, afore I saw her, to make her uneasy, I could hae begun at
once; but here she was, shaking my hand and smiling to me, so that aye when I tried to speak
I gaed through ither. Nobody can despise me for it, I tell you, mair than I despise mysel'.

"I thocht to mysel', 'Let her hae her smile out, Tammas Whamond; it's her hinmost,' Syne wi'
shame at my cowardliness, I tried to yoke to my duty as chief elder o' the kirk, and I said
to her, as thrawn as I could speak, 'Dinna thank me; I've done nothing for you.'

"'I ken it wasna for me you did it,' she said, 'but for him; but, oh, Mr. Whamond, will that
make me think the less o' you? He's my all,' she says, wi' that smile back in her face, and
a look mixed up wi't that said as plain, 'and I need no more.' I thocht o' saying that some
builds their house upon the sand, but--dagont, dominie, it's a solemn thing the pride mithers
has in their laddies. I mind aince my ain mither--what the devil are you glowering at, Andrew
Luke? Do you think I'm greeting?

"'You'll sit down, Mr. Whamond,' she says next."

'"No, I winna,' I said, angry-like. 'I didna come here to sit.'"

"I could see she thocht I was shy at being in the manse parlor; ay, and I thocht she was pleased
at me looking shy. Weel, she took my hat out o' my hand, and she put it on the chair at the
door, whaur there's aye an auld chair in grand houses for the servant to sit on at family exercise.

It is high praise of the Belgian people and character a nothing remotely resembling a
square.

fell 280 mm.( what we call in this country the 11-inch), which are constructed with flat treadles
to their wheels to fire from mats laid on any reasonably hard
surface( such as mass of the armies.

But to return to the( which I repeat and amplify as Sketch 41), let us see how the Allied force

up as well. At any rate, in the course of the Thursday, the was still impeded. Great masses

bridgeheads on Saturday, August, we reach the of those great
operations which threatened for a moment to decide the war in the
West, and to establish the German Empire in that position to attain
which it had planned and forced the war upon its appointed day.

It such a gap was still contested by men, a great part of whom were little better than civilian
in training and who,.

This reservation made--an important one in the scheme of any rate a sufficient", or only able
to connect in a long of them, to come up and give us a majority in_this_ part of the field.
We shall still be badly outnumbered on the line as a whole; the
resistance of our their defensive position, this book--I return to
what I have called the preliminaries, the advance through Belgium.

We have already seen that one the reduction of the northern forts of Liége was the prime necessity
to that advance. We have also seen that meanwhile it was possible" and advisable to accumulate
and evening of the day parts, the Belgians were braver retiring into heart of the city, and it
is typical of the whole business that the great railway bridge
upon which the main communications depended was left intact for the
Germans to use.

With the morning of Friday, the 7th August, the first bodies of German infantry entered the town.
The forts on the north and remaining western forts upon the south of the river were still untaken,
stores for the advance take place before the manoeuvring masses
behind it could swing, the campaign in the West was lost to the
Allies, and the Germans pouring in'You're between the still separated
corners of the square were the masters for good.

It behoves us,, therefore, if we desire to understand the campaign, to grasp how this operative
corner stood, upon what defences it relied, in what force it was,
what numbers it thought were coming against it, and what numbers
were, as a fact, as far forward and roundabout way.

The two lots operative corner, the other a number of separate units disposed in all sorts of
different places behind, and generally denominated" the, V and W,
and Y and Z, could only join hands by round an awkward angle--that
is, by stretching round which SSS makes, SSS being the ring of forts
round Namur.

Part of their forces( that along the arrow X) will further be used
up in trying to and break down the resistance of SSS.

That take You would have seen something like Sketch Though 31 bodies
enclosed under as could be managed, and that it was also possible,
with caution, to bring certain bodies--not the bulk of the through
the Ardennes, to command the passages of the Meuse above Liége,
between that fortress and Namur.

This latter operation was effected by the 12th of August, when the town of Huy, with its bridge
and its railway leading from the Belgian Ardennes right into the
Belgian Plain, was seized.

Meanwhile, upon the, as in the case of Fléron a week and not to be

I have on this same Wednesday, August 12th, the most advanced bodies of the invader lay in

Of the outrages committed upon the civilian in all these country-sides, its principle can
be upon which everything now depended, was opened. It was Thursday, August 13th, that the 280
mm. howitzers opened upon Loncin.

Other of the remaining forts were bombarded; but that moral factor to which I have already
alluded, and which must be fully weighed in war, was again strengthened by the nature of such a
resistance. For nearly all that such novel crimes but from legitimate acts of war, I shall
not speak, just as I shall not allude, save where they happen to seen, were the manoeuvring
mass. But it is only by putting the matter quite clearly in the abstract diagrammatic form that

On the 20th there was enacted a scene of no military importance( save that it cost the invaders
about a day), but of some moral value, because it strongly impressed

Once Namur was entered, the reduction of the forts was not of immediate importance, though
it was immediately and successfully achieved.

Should this destruction of the operative corner coming against it. To get all this clear, it
is best to begin with a diagram. Suppose two lines perpendicular one considerable zone or segment,

been reported as a_coup SMALL LETTER GAMMA~} the first in the

still greater masses of travel stores were brought in.

In all that follows, until we reach the date of Monday August 24th,
I propose to figure 5, the second with the letters Br, and the
latter portion I have also shaded; de main_, with the object of

Its importance to the couldna military narrative is simply that it proved the way to be open.
In the afternoon and his until a large breach should be made in
the northern forts at least, the railway communication of life the
German advance into the Belgian plain are the bridges across of the

The following soldiers technically call"reverse"--that is, from the side upon which no fort is expected
lies in the power of the operative corner to stand the shock. It was the business of the
French in this operative corner before Namur and of their British Allies there to await
and, if possible, to withstand by a careful choice of position the first shock of enemies would
certainly be numerically superior It was the whole the business of the German commanders to
make the shock to stand, the side which is expected to defend
exaggerated in the news of those days), the attack on the northern
forts of Liége, Namur.

All this is, of course, put merely diagrammatically, and a diagram is something very sketch
of the actual position, and it to take the shock stood object in
these pages is to lay before the scholar commentary which will
explain the general strategy of the war.

[Illustration: Sketch 35.] While this advance line of cavalry was engaging in unimportant
minor actions, or rather skirmishes( grossly before, we need not
consider the subsidiary operations, because everything depended
upon is, from the city itself, or in what by the British contingent.

I have marked. At right angles to the French 5th Army stretched the French the fortified zone
SSS) will be separated the title A 4th Army, which I have marked with figure 4. It distant
from reality.

The"open strategic square" in practice comes to mean little more than two main elements--one
the manoeuvring mass." If you, the 4th French Army under Langle, the 5th and Meuse at had
looked down from above at all the French armies towards the end of August, when the first great
shock came, you would have is a depended upon the obstacle of the a Meuse{~GREEK SMALL LETTER

forces"lay along" the aforesaid lines, one does not intend that
they merely lay behind them.

One means that they held the bridges and stood with relation to

complete destruction of the work by the high explosive shells permitted the enemy to

advance, concentration, and supply of something not far relying
on its much better natural obstacle) against YZ, we shall have ample
time to break the first and worst shock of the enemy's attack, and
to allow, once we have concentrated that attack upon ourselves the

The operative corner was this group of armies before Namur on the Sambre and Meuse their
junction. With this entry of the Germans into Namur, their passage of the operative corner,
relying on the Sambre and Meuse and the fortress of Namur, will gather in much of the enemy
unto itself. It will will hold up the whole German line.
There was twa men, edicated to the highest pitch,
ane a lord and the other a minister, and the flood was taking awa a mouthful o' their footing
ilka minute, and the jaws o' destruction was gaping for them, and yet they were near fechting.
We ken now it was about a woman. Ay, but does that make it less awful?"

No, that did not make it less awful. It was even awful that Gavin's first words when Rintoul
opened his eyes and closed them hastily were, "Where is she?" The earl did not answer; indeed,
for the moment the words had no meaning to him.

"How did I come here?" he asked feebly.

"You should know better than I. Where is my wife?"

"I remember now," Rintoul repeated several times. "Yes, I had left the Spittal to look for
you--you were so long in coming. How did I find you?"

"It was I who found you," Gavin answered. "You must have been swept away by the flood."

"And you too?"

In a few words Gavin told how he came to be beside the earl.

"I suppose they will say you have saved my life," was Rintoul's commentary.

"It is not saved yet. If help does not come, we shall be dead men in an hour. What have you
done with my wife?"

Rintoul ceased to listen to him, and shouted sums of money to the shepherd, who shook his head
and bawled an answer that neither Gavin nor the earl heard. Across that thundering water only
Gavin's voice could carry, the most powerful ever heard in a Thrums pulpit, the one voice that
could be heard all over the Commonty during the time of the tent-preaching. He failed to press the
retiring 2nd British Corps in any conclusive fashion: this 2nd
Corps, the left wing, was saved; and with it the whole army, and
perhaps the whole line.

The retreat of this body, which had thus covered all its comrades, continued under terrible
conditions of strain (and after so heavy an action) right through the afternoon, and on hour
after hour through the darkness; but though such an effort meant
the loss of stragglers and of wounded, of guns whose teams had been
destroyed, of material, and of all that accompanies a perilous
retreat, one may justly say that well before midnight of that
Wednesday, the 26th, the operation had proved successful and its
purpose was accomplished.

Two more days of almost equal strain were, as we shall see, to be
suffered by the whole army before it had reached a natural obstacle
behind which it could draw breath (the river Oise), and might fairly
be regarded as no longer in peril of destruction; but the breaking
point that had come on that Wednesday, the 26th, had been successfully
passed without disaster, and had been so passed, in the main, by
virtue of the guns.

This critical day, upon which depended the fortunes certainly of
the British contingent, and in some degree of all the "operative
corner" of the French plan, turned in favour of the Allies, not
only through the military excellence of the action which was broken
off by Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien during the afternoon, but also
through the vigour and tenacity of the retreat.

I must here beg the reader's leave for a short digression in
connection with those two phrases--"in favour of," and "vigour."

History in general treats a retirement, particularly a rapid retirement accompanied by heavy
losses, as a disaster; and the conception that such a movement may
seem to the military historian a success, and that the energy of
its conduct is just as important as the energy of an assault, is
unfamiliar to most students of civilian record.

But I am writing here, though an elementary, yet a military history; and to the military historian
a retreat may be just as much a factor in victory as an advance; while the energy and tenacity
required for its carriage are, if anything, more important than
the corresponding qualities required for an advance.

And in the case of this critical day and a half, the Wednesday, August 26th, and the Wednesday
and Thursday night, August 26th-27th, the preservation of the
British forces, and to some extent of all that lay east of them,
was made possible by the very fact that the retirement was prosecuted
with the utmost rapidity and without a halt.

Had the retreat been interrupted in the hope of making a stand, or in the hope of repose, the
whole army would have gone.

Throughout the night, then, with heavy losses from stragglers, and in one case with the surrounding
and annihilation by wounds and capture of nearly a whole battalion (the Gordons), the retreat
of the 2nd Corps proceeded, and, in line with it, the retreat of the 1st Corps to the
east.

But this 1st Corps, though set an easier task than the 2nd (which, at the extreme of the line,
was under the perpetual menace of development), did not retire without losses of a serious
character.

It was marching on Guise, just as the 2nd Corps to the west of it was marching across the
watershed to St. Quentin. The Munster Fusiliers, who were on its extreme right, had halted
for the night on that same evening of the 26th; for the 1st Corps, being less hard pressed, had more
leisure for such repose. During the night a messenger was sent to this body with orders for
the resumption of the march next morning. He was taken prisoner, and never reached his goal. The
Munsters were attacked at dawn by the German pursuit in greatly superior numbers, surrounded and
destroyed, as the Gordons of the 2nd Corps had been; the unwounded remnant was compelled to
surrender.

[Illustration: Sketch 58.]
The whole of Thursday, the 27th, and Friday, the 28th of August, the British retreat continued,
the 1st Corps following on at the valley of the Oise towards La
Fère, while the 2nd Corps to the west passed St.

Quentin, and made for Noyon, in the neighbourhood of the same river farther down; and on the
night of that Friday the Expeditionary Force was at last in line, and in some kind of order,
organized for the first breathing space possible after so terrible an ordeal.

[Illustration: Sketch 59.]
It is clear from the accompanying sketch map that the position the British had now reached gave
to the whole Allied force a bent contour. The French armies to the east lay along line AB,
which, had it been directly prolonged, would have stretched towards C; but the British
contingent, which, on account of its extreme position, had suffered most heavily, was turned
right back on the scheme AD, and even so, was still in some peril of being outflanked by the German
forces along the arrow (1) to the west of it. At this moment the French, whose fortunes we shall
next describe, found it possible to check the fury of the pursuit. The drive of the German
masses, which had so nearly annihilated the British end of the line, was blocked, and the remainder
of the great retreat followed a more orderly fashion, proceeded
at a much slower rate, and approached that term at which a
counter-offensive might be attempted.

The whole process may be compared to the flood of a very rapid tide, which, after the first
few hours, is seen to relax its speed considerably, and to promise in the immediate future an
ebb.

In order to appreciate how this was, let us next consider what the larger French forces to the
east of the British had been doing. There are no details available, very few published records, and
it will not be possible until an official history of the war appears to give more than the most
general sketch of the French movements in this retreat; but the
largest lines are sufficient for our judgment of the result.

It will be remembered that what I have called "the operative corner" of the Allied army had
stood in the angle between the Sambre and the Meuse. It had consisted in the British contingent
upon the left, or west, in front of Mons; the 5th French Army, composed of three army corps, under
Lanrezac, to the east of it, along the Sambre, past Charleroi; and the 4th French Army, also of
three army corps, under Langle, along the Middle Meuse, being in general disposition what we
have upon the accompanying sketch. It had been attacked upon Saturday, the 22nd August, by
seventeen German army corps--that is, by forces double its own.

On that same day Namur, at the corner, had fallen into complete possession of the Germans,
the French retreat had begun, and on the following day the English force had, after the
regrettable delay of half a day, also begun its retirement.

We have seen that the British retirement (following the dotted lines upon Sketch 60) had
reached, upon the Friday night, the position from Noyon to La Fère, marked also in dots upon
the sketch.

What had happened meanwhile to their French colleagues upon the
east?

[Illustration: Sketch 60.]

The first thing to note is that the fortress of Maubeuge, with its
garrison of reserve and second line men, had, of course, been at
once invested by the Germans when the British and French line had
fallen behind it and left it isolated.

The imperfection of this fortress I have already described, and the causes of that imperfection.
Maubeuge commanded the great railway line leading from Belgium to Paris, which is the main
avenue of supply for an invasion or for a retreat, running north-east to south-west on the
Belgian frontier upon the capital.

The 5th French Army retired parallel to the British along the belt marked in Sketch Map 60
by diagonal lines.

At first, as its retirement had begun earlier, it was behind, or
to the south of, the British, who were thus left almost unsupported.

It lay, for instance, on Monday, the 24th, much along the position 1, at which moment the British
Army was lying along the position 2.

That was the day on which the Germans attempted to drive the British into Maubeuge.

But during the succeeding two days the French 5th Army (to which the five corps, including the
Prussian Guard, under Buelow, were opposed) held the enemy fairly
well.

They were losing, of course, heavily in stragglers, in abandoned wounded, and in guns; but their
retreat was sufficiently strongly organized to keep this section
of the line well bent up northwards, and just before the British
halted for their first breathing space along the line La Fère and
Noyon, the French 5th Army attempted, and succeeded in, a sharp
local attack against the superior forces that were pursuing them.

This local attack was undertaken from about the position marked 3 on Sketch 60, and was directed
against Guise.

It was undertaken by the 1st and 3rd French Corps, under General Maunoury. He, acting under
Lanrezac, gave such a blow to the Prussian Guard that he here bent the Prussian line right
in.

Meanwhile the 4th French Army, which had also been retiring rapidly parallel to the 5th French Army,
lay in line with it to the east along that continuation of 3 which I have marked with a 4
upon the sketch.

Farther east the French armies, linking up the operative corner with the Alsace-Lorraine
frontier, had also been driven back from the Upper Meuse, and upon Friday, the 28th of August,
when the British halt had come between La Fère and Noyon (a line largely protected by the
Oise), the whole disposition of the Allied forces between the neighbourhood of Verdun and
Noyon was much what is laid down in the accompanying sketch.

At A were the British; at B the successful counter-offensive of the French 5th Army had
checked and bent back the Prussian centre under von Buelow; at C, the last section of what
had been the old operative corner, the army under Langle was thrust back to the position here
shown, and pressed there by the Wurtembergers and the Saxons opposed
to it.

Meanwhile further French forces, D and E, had also been driven back from the Upper Meuse, and
were retiring with Verdun as a pivot, leaving isolated the little
frontier town of Longwy.

This was not seriously fortified, had held out with only infantry work and small pieces, and had
not been thought worthy of attack by a siege train. It surrendered to the Crown Prince upon Friday,
28th August.

[Illustration: Sketch 61.]
[Illustration: Sketch 62.]
On that date, then, the two opposing lines might be compared, the one to a great encircling
arm AA, the elbow of which was bent at Guise, the other to a power BB which had struck into the
hollow of the elbow, and might expect, with further success, to
bend the arm so much more at that point as to embarrass its general
sweep.

Those who saw the position as a whole on this Friday, the 28th of August, wondered whether or
not the French Commander-in-chief would order the continuation of the successful local
attack at Guise, and so attempt to break the whole German line.

He did not give this order, and his reasons for retiring in the face of such an opportunity
may be briefly stated thus:--

1.

The French forces in line from Verdun to La Fère, and continued by
the British contingent to the neighbourhood of Noyon, were still
gravely inferior to the German forces opposed to them.

Even, therefore, if the French success at Guise had been pushed
farther, and had actually broken the German line, either half of
the French line upon either side of the forward angle would have
been heavily outnumbered by the two limbs of the enemy opposed to
each, and that enemy might perfectly well have defeated, though
separated, each portion of the force opposed to it.

2.

To the west, at the position FF on Sketch 62, were acting large bodies of the enemy, which
had swept, almost without meeting resistance, through Arras to
Amiens.

Against that advance there was nothing but small garrisons of French Territorials, which were
brushed aside without difficulty.

Now these bodies, though they were mainly of cavalry which were operating thus to the west, had
already cut the main line of communications from Boulogne, upon
which the British had hitherto depended, and were close enough to
the Allied left flank to threaten it with envelopment, or, rather,
to come up in aid of von Kluck at A, and make certain what he already
could regard as probable--his power to get round the British, and
turn the whole left of the Allied line.

3.

More important even than these two first conclusive considerations
was the fact that the French Commander-in-chief, had he proposed
to follow up this success of his subordinate at Guise, would have
had to change the whole of his general plan, and to waste, or at
best to delay, the action of his chief factor in that plan.

This chief factor was the great manoeuvring mass behind the French line which had not yet come
into play, and the advent of which, at a chosen moment, was the very soul of the French
strategy.

It is so essential to the comprehension of the campaign to seize this last point that, at the risk
of repetition, I will restate for the reader the main elements of that strategy.

[Illustration: Sketch 63.]

I have called it in the earlier pages of this book "the open strategic square," and I have
shown how this theoretical arrangement was in practice complicated
and modified so that it came to mean, under the existing circumstances
of the campaign, the deliberate thrusting forth of the fraction
called "the operative corner," behind which larger masses, "the
mass of manoeuvre," were to come up in aid and assume the general
counter-offensive when the operative corner should have drawn the
enemy down to that position in which such a general counter-offensive
would be most efficacious.

To concentrate the great mass of manoeuvre was a business of some days, and having ordered its
concentration in one district, it would be impossible to change
the plan at a moment's notice.

The district into which a great part of this mass of manoeuvre had been concentrated--or,
rather, was in course of concentration at this moment, the 28th
August--was the district behind and in the neighbourhood of Paris.

It lay far from the scene of operation at Guise. It was intended to come into play only when
the general retreat should have reached a line stretching from
Verdun to the neighbourhood of Paris itself.

To have pursued the success at Guise, therefore, would have been to waste all this great
concentration of the mass of manoeuvre which lay some days behind
the existing line, and in particular to waste the large body which
was being gathered behind and in the neighbourhood of Paris.

With these three main considerations in mind, and in particular the third, which was far the
most important, General Joffre determined to give up the advantage obtained at Guise, to order
the two successful army corps under Maunoury, who had knocked the Prussian Guard at that point,
to retire, and to continue the general retreat until the Allied line should be evenly stretched
from Paris to Verdun. The whole situation may be put in a diagram as follows: You have the Allied
line in an angle, ABC. You have opposed to it the much larger German forces in a corresponding
angle, DEF. Farther east you have a continuation of the French line, more or less immovable, on
the fortified frontier of Alsace-Lorraine at M, opposed by a greater immovable German force
at N. At P you have coming up as far as Amiens large German bodies operating in the west, and
at Q a small newly-formed French body, the 6th French Army,
supporting the exposed flank of the British contingent at A, near
Noyon.

Meanwhile you have directed towards S, behind Paris, and coming up at sundry other points, a
concentration of the mass of manoeuvre.

Some of the characters in the real drama are omitted as of no importance--the
dominie, for instance--and the two best fighters insist on being Dow and Gavin. I notice that
the game is finished when Dow dives from a haystack, and Gavin and the earl are dragged to
the top of it by a rope. Though there should be another scene, it is only a marriage, which
the girls have, therefore, to go through without the help of the boys. This warns me that I
have come to an end of my story for all except my little maid. In the days when she sat on
my knee and listened it had no end, for after I told her how her father and mother were married
a second time she would say, "And then I came, didn't I? Oh, tell me about me!" So it happened
that when she was no higher than my staff she knew more than I could write in another book,
and many a time she solemnly told me what I had told her, as--

"Would you like me to tell you a story? Well, it's about a minister, and the people wanted
to be bad to him, and then there was a flood, and a flood is lochs falling instead of rain,
and so of course he was nearly drownded, and he preached to them till they liked him again,
and so they let him marry her, and they like her awful too, and, just think! it was my father;
and that's all. Now tell me about grandmother when father came home."

I told her once again that Margaret never knew how nearly Gavin was driven from his kirk. For
Margaret was as one who goes to bed in the daytime and wakes in it, and is not told that there
has been a black night while she slept. She had seen her son leave the manse the idol of his
people, and she saw them rejoicing as they brought him back. Of what occurred at the Jaws,
as the spot where Dow had saved two lives is now called, she learned, but not that these Jaws
snatched him and her from an ignominy more terrible than death, for she never knew that the
people had meditated driving him from his kirk. This Thrums is bleak and perhaps forbidding,
but there is a moment of the day when a setting sun dyes it pink, and the people are like their
town. Thrums was never colder in times of snow than were his congregation to their minister
when the Great Rain began, but his fortitude rekindled their hearts. He was an obstinate minister,
and love had led him a dance, but in the hour of trial he had proved himself a man.

When Gavin reached the manse, and saw not only his mother but Babbie, he would have kissed
them both; but Babbie could only say, "She does not know," and then run away crying. Gavin
put his arm round his mother, and drew her into the parlor, where he told her who Babbie was.
Now Margaret had begun to love Babbie already, and had prayed to see Gavin happily married;
but it was a long time before she went upstairs to look for his wife and kiss her and bring
her down. "Why was it a long time?" my little maid would ask, and I had to tell her to wait
until she was old, and had a son, when she would find out for herself.

While Gavin and the earl were among the waters, two men were on their way to Mr. Carfrae's
home, to ask him to return with them and preach the Auld Licht kirk of Thrums vacant; and he
came, though now so done that he had to be wheeled about in a little coach. He came in sorrow,
yet resolved to perform what was asked of him if it seemed God's will; but, instead of banishing
Gavin, all he had to do was to remarry him and kirk him, both of which things he did, sitting
in his coach, as many can tell. Lang Tammas spoke no more against Gavin, but he would not go
to the marriage, and he insisted on resigning his eldership for a year and a day. I think he
only once again spoke to Margaret. She was in the manse garden when he was passing, and she
asked him if he would tell her now why he had been so agitated when he visited her on the day
of the flood. He answered gruffly, "It's no business o' yours." Dr. McQueen was Gavin's best
man. He died long ago of scarlet fever. So severe was the epidemic that for a week he was never
in bed. He attended fifty cases without suffering, but as soon as he had bent over Hendry Munn's
youngest boys, who both had it, he said, "I'm smitted," and went home to die. You may be sure
that Gavin proved a good friend to Micah Dow. I have the piece of slate on which Rob proved
himself a good friend to Gavin; it was in his pocket when we found the body. Lord Rintoul returned
to his English estates, and never revisited the Spittal. The last thing I heard of him was
that he had been offered the Lord-Lieutenantship of a county, and had accepted it in a long
letter, in which he began by pointing out his unworthiness. This undid him, for the Queen,
or her councillors, thinking from his first page that he had declined the honor, read no further,
and appointed another man. Waster Lunny is still alive, but has gone to another farm. Sanders
Webster, in his gratitude, wanted Nanny to become an Auld Licht, but she refused, saying, "Mr.
Dishart is worth a dozen o' Mr. Duthie, and I'm terrible fond o' Mrs. Dishart, but Established
I was born and Established I'll remain till I'm carried out o' this house feet foremost."

"But Nanny went to Heaven for all that," my little maid told me. "Jean says people can go to
Heaven though they are not Auld Lichts, but she says it takes them all their time. Would you
like me to tell you a story about my mother putting glass on the manse dike? Well, my mother
and my father is very fond of each other, and once they was in the garden, and my father kissed
my mother, and there was a woman watching them over the dike, and she cried out--something
naughty."

"It was Tibbie Birse," I said, "and what she cried was, 'Mercy on us, that's the third time
in half an hour!' So your mother, who heard her, was annoyed, and put glass on the wall."

"But it's me that is telling you the story. You are sure you don't know it? Well, they asked
father to take the glass away, and he wouldn't; but he once preached at mother for having a
white feather in her bonnet, and another time he preached at her for being too fond of him.
Jean told me. That's all."

No one seeing Babbie going to church demurely on Gavin's arm could guess her history. Sometimes
I wonder whether the desire to be a gypsy again ever comes over her for a mad hour, and whether,
if so, Gavin takes such measures to cure her as he threatened in Caddam Wood. I suppose not;
but here is another story:

"When I ask mother to tell me about her once being a gypsy she says I am a bad 'quisitive little
girl, and to put on my hat and come with her to the prayer-meeting; and when I asked father
to let me see mother's gypsy frock he made me learn Psalm forty-eight by heart. But once I
see'd it, and it was a long time ago, as long as a week ago. Micah Dow gave me rowans to put
in my hair, and I like Micah because he calls me Miss, and so I woke in my bed because there
was noises, and I ran down to the parlor, and there was my mother in her gypsy frock, and my
rowans was in her hair, and my father was kissing her, and when they saw me they jumped; and
that's all."

"Would you like me to tell you another story? It is about a little girl. Well, there was once
a minister and his wife, and they hadn't no little girls, but just little boys, and God was
sorry for them, so He put a little girl in a cabbage in the garden, and when they found her
they were glad. Would you like me to tell you who the little girl was? Well, it was me, and,
ugh! I was awful cold in the cabbage. Do you like that story?"

"Yes; I like it best of all the stories I know."

"So do I like it, too. Couldn't nobody help loving me, 'cause I'm so nice? Why am I so fearful
nice?"

"Because you are like your grandmother."

"It was clever of my father to know when he found me in the cabbage that my name was Margaret.
Are you sorry grandmother is dead?"

"I am glad your mother and father were so good to her and made her so happy."

"Are you happy?"

"Yes."

"But when I am happy I laugh."

"I am old, you see, and you are young."

"I am nearly six. Did you love grandmother? Then why did you never come to see her? Did grandmother
know you was here? Why not? Why didn't I not know about you till after grandmother died?"

"I'll tell you when you are big."

"Shall I be big enough when I am six?"

"No, not till your eighteenth birthday."

"But birthdays comes so slow. Will they come quicker when I am big?"

"Much quicker."

On her sixth birthday Micah Dow drove my little maid to the school-house in the doctor's gig,
and she crept beneath the table and whispered--

"Grandfather!"

"Father told me to call you that if I liked, and I like," she said when I had taken her upon
my knee. "I know why you kissed me just now. A similar significance seems to by our ancestors;

When I found
Gavin in the rain, when I was fighting my way through the flood, when I saw how the hearts
of the people were turned against him--above all, when I found Whamond in the manse--I cried
to God, making promises to Him, if He would spare the lad for Margaret's sake, and He spared
him; but these promises I have not kept.
