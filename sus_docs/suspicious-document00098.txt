Having crossed the strait at its narrowest part four miles in width, we caught sight of the
beautiful waters of _Lake Michigan_, the only one in the group of the North American great
lakes which extends entirely within the territory of the United States, having a maximum breadth
of eighty four miles, and a depth varying from 700 to 1,000 feet. Are your stronger your

Having achieved a course of sixty miles, the yacht cast anchor in the excellent harbor of St.
James on _Beaver Island_, a large tract of land covering an area of 3,700 acres. "They do say
so, Mr. C.; for my part I am quite out of patience with the art of the young man; I dare say
he is no better than he should be; he always had a sharp look, and for aught I know there may
be more in that robbery than you or I dreamed of, Mr. Copperas. It was a pity," continued Mrs.
Copperas, upbraiding her lord with true matrimonial tenderness and justice, for the consequences
of his having acted from her advice,--"it was a pity, Mr. C., that you should have refused
to lend him the pistols to go to the old fellow's assistance, for then who knows but--"
"I might have converted them into pocket pistols," interrupted Mr.

C., "and not have overshot the mark, my dear--ha, ha, ha!"
"Lord, Mr. Copperas, you are always making a joke of everything."
"No, my dear, for once I am making a joke of nothing."
"Well, I declare it's shameful," cried Mrs.

Copperas, still following up her own indignant meditations, "and after taking such notice of
Adolphus, too, and all!"
"Notice, my dear! mere words," returned Mr.

Copperas, "mere words, like ventilators, which make a great deal of air, but never raise the
wind; but don't put yourself in a stew, my love, for the doctors say that copperas in a stew is
poison!"
At this moment Mr. de Warens, throwing open the door, announced Mr. Brown; that gentleman
entered, with a sedate but cheerful air. "Well, Mrs. Copperas, your servant; any table-linen
wanted?
Mr. Copperas, how do you do?

I can give you a hint about the stocks. Master Copperas, you are looking bravely; don't you think
he wants some new pinbefores, ma'am? But Mr. Clarence Linden, where is he? Not up yet, I dare
say. Ah, the present generation is a generation of sluggards, as his worthy aunt, Mrs. Minden,
used to say."
"I am sure," said Mrs. Copperas, with a disdainful toss of the head, "I know nothing about the
young man. He has left us; a very mysterious piece of business indeed, Mr. Brown; and now I
think of it, I can't help saying that we were by no means pleased with your introduction:
and, by the by, the chairs you bought for us at the sale were a
mere take-in, so slight that Mr. Walruss broke two of them by only
sitting down."
"Indeed, ma'am?" said Mr. Brown, with expostulating gravity; "but
then Mr. Walruss is so very corpulent. But the young gentleman,
what of him?" continued the broker, artfully turning from the point
in dispute.
"Lord, Mr. Brown, don't ask me: it was the unluckiest step we ever
made to admit him into the bosom of our family; quite a viper, I
assure you; absolutely robbed poor Adolphus."The population of the city has rapidly increased
in later years, comprising about 14,000 residents at present. The surrounding district is especially
adapted for fruit-growing; and sportsmen are attracted to the Manistee River and its tributaries
by the abundance of the otherwise rarely found grayling.

Since we expected company on board the "Marguerite" in the evening--Mr. Wilkinson, a citizen
of Milwaukee, who intended to make us acquainted with his wife, we went on shore immediately
after dinner to view the city, so as to return in time to meet our visitors.

Manistee made the impression of a flourishing business town. Even reached Clarence found
himself excluded from the presence of his friend; even his nearest relation, who stud was
on the very ground which he hallowed with his footstep and attenuated
with fierce struggles, which his bones worked from his whitening

to Warner that the, was banished from the most placid, and and jaded
nerves, all contributed to waste the health of while they excited

A crimson spot, never lake before seen there, burned in the centre long his pale cheek; his
eye glowed with a brilliant unnatural fire; of human beings,, Warner the haunted sanctuary of

keen interest in the success of impatience of the strained towering, turned from proper and
kindly union, seemed contesting, should the mastery and the triumph. But neither his more
youthful and inexperienced genius,--it was peculiar object of want

The present population is estimated to comprise about 24,000.

While admiring the lovely scenery enhanced by an enchanting sunset, from the deck of the yacht,
our attention was distracted by approaching footsteps. In the uncertain, fading daylight, we
perceived a gentleman accompanied by a lady--curiously regarding us--whom we invited on board
the "Marguerite."

Mrs. and Mr. Wickham were the names by which this fair couple was introduced. That they spent
the evening in our company, was very acceptable to us--as we but rarely had visitors on our
pilgrimage. The skies were darkened with clouds,--" And the dim stars rushed through them
