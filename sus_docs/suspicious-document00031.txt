Mr. CROWL, being called, was extremely agitated. He refused to take the oath, and informed
the court that the Bible was a Fad. He could not swear by anything so self-contradictory. He
would affirm. He could not deny--though he looked like wishing to--that the prisoner had at
first been rather mistrustful of Mr. ZANGWILL.

-----
Wild-Reindeer stalking is hardly so exciting a sport as the evening's verandah talk in Norroway
hotels would lead the trustful traveller to suppose. Under the charge of your guide, a very
young man with the dreamy, wistful eyes of those who live in valleys, you leave the farmstead
early in the forenoon, arriving towards twilight at the desolate hut which, for so long as
you remain upon the uplands, will be your somewhat cheerless headquarters.

Next morning, in the chill, mist-laden dawn you rise; and, after a breakfast of coffee and dried
fish, shoulder your Remington, and step forth silently into the raw, damp air; the guide locking
the door behind you, the key grating harshly in the rusty lock.

For hour after hour you toil over the steep, stony ground, or wind through the pines, speaking
in whispers, lest your voice reach the quick ears of your prey, that keeps its head ever pressed
against the wind. Here and there, in the hollows of the hills, lie wide fields of snow,
over which you pick your steps thoughtfully, listening to the smothered thunder of the
torrent, tunnelling its way beneath your feet, and wondering whether the frozen arch above it
be at all points as firm as is desirable. Now and again, as in single file you walk cautiously
along some jagged ridge, you catch glimpses of the green world, three thousand feet below you;
though you gaze not long upon the view, for your attention is chiefly directed to watching the
footprints of the guide, lest by deviating to the right or left you find yourself at one
stride back in the valley--or, to be more correct, are found there.

These things you do, and as exercise they are healthful and invigorating. But a reindeer you
never see, and unless, overcoming the prejudices of your British-bred conscience, you care to
take an occasional pop at a fox, you had better have left your rifle at the hut, and, instead,
have brought a stick, which would have been helpful. Notwithstanding which the guide continues
sanguine, and in broken English, helped out by stirring gesture, tells of the terrible slaughter
generally done by sportsmen under his superintendence, and of the vast herds that generally infest
these fjelds; and when you grow sceptical upon the subject of Reins he whispers alluringly of
Bears.

Once in a way you will come across a track, and will follow it breathlessly for hours, and
it will lead to a sheer precipice. Whether the explanation is
suicide, or a reprehensible tendency on the part of the animal
towards practical joking, you are left to decide for yourself. Then,
with many rough miles between you and your rest, you abandon the
chase.

But I speak from personal experience merely.
All day long we had tramped through the pitiless rain, stopping
only for an hour at noon to eat some dried venison, and smoke a
pipe beneath the shelter of an overhanging cliff. Soon afterwards
Michael knocked over a ryper (a bird that will hardly take the
trouble to hop out of your way) with his gun-barrel, which incident
cheered us a little, and, later on, our flagging spirits were still
further revived by the discovery of apparently very recent
deer-tracks.
These we followed, forgetful, in our eagerness, of the lengthening
distance back to the hut, of the fading daylight, of the gathering
mist. The track led us higher and higher, further and further into
the mountains, until on the shores of a desolate rock-bound vand
it abruptly ended, and we stood staring at one another, and the
snow began to fall.
Unless in the next half-hour we could chance upon a saeter, this
meant passing the night upon the mountain. Michael and I looked at
the guide, but though, with characteristic Norwegian sturdiness,
he put a bold face upon it, we could see that in that deepening
darkness he knew no more than we did. Wasting no time on words, we
made straight for the nearest point of descent, knowing that any
human habitation must be far below us.
Down we scrambled, heedless of torn clothes and bleeding hands, the
darkness pressing closer round us. Then suddenly it became black--black
as pitch--and we could only hear each other.
Another step might mean death. We stretched out our hands, and felt
each other. Why we spoke in whispers, I do not know, but we seemed
afraid of our own voices. We agreed there was nothing for it but
to stop where we were till morning, clinging to the short grass;
so we lay there side by side, for what may have been five minutes
or may have been an hour. Then, attempting to turn, I lost my grip
and rolled.Still, this we
can now never know, unless the dead speak or the absent return. It is also not impossible that
Miss Dymond was entrusted with the £25 for charitable purposes. But to come back to certainties.
[Illustration: "CLINGING TO THE SHORT GRASS."]
Rising and groping about me, I found an opening, and passed through, and crept forward with palms
outstretched until I touched the logs of a hut; then, feeling my way round, discovered the door,
and knocked. There came no response, so I knocked louder; then pushed, and the heavy woodwork
yielded, groaning. But the darkness within was even darker than the darkness without.
The others had contrived to crawl down and join me. Michael struck a wax vesta and held it
up, and slowly the room came out of the darkness and stood round us.

Then something rather startling happened. Giving one swift glance about him, our guide uttered a
cry, and rushed out into the night, and disappeared. We followed to the door, and called
after him, but only a voice came to us out of the blackness, and the only words that we could
catch, shrieked back in terror, were: "The woman of the saeter--the woman of the saeter."
"Some foolish superstition about the place, I suppose," said Michael. "In these mountain
solitudes men breed ghosts for company. Let us make a fire. Perhaps, when he sees the light,
his desire for food and shelter may get the better of his fears."
We felt about in the small enclosure round the house, and gathered juniper and birch-twigs,
and kindled a fire upon the open stove built in the corner of the room. Fortunately, we had
some dried reindeer and bread in our bag, and on that and the ryper, and the contents of our
flasks, we supped. Afterwards, to while away the time, we made an inspection of the strange
eyrie we had lighted on.

It was an old log-built saeter. Some of these mountain farmsteads are as old as the stone ruins
of other countries. Carvings of strange beasts and demons were upon its blackened rafters, and
on the lintel, in runic letters, ran this legend: "Hund builded me in the days of Haarfager."
The house consisted of two large apartments. Originally, no doubt, these had been separate
dwellings standing beside one another, but they were now connected by a long, low gallery.
Most of the scanty furniture was almost as ancient as the walls themselves, but many articles
of a comparatively recent date had been added. All was now, however, rotting and falling into
decay.

[Illustration: "BY THE DULL GLOW OF THE BURNING JUNIPER TWIGS."]

The place appeared to have been deserted suddenly by its last occupants. Household utensils lay as they
were left, rust and dirt encrusted on them. An open book, limp and mildewed, lay face downwards
on the table, while many others were scattered about both rooms, together with much paper,
scored with faded ink. The curtains hung in shreds about the windows; a woman's cloak, of an
antiquated fashion, drooped from a nail behind the door. In an oak chest we found a tumbled
heap of yellow letters. They were of various dates, extending over a period of four months,
and with them, apparently intended to receive them, lay a large envelope, inscribed with an
address in London that has since disappeared.

Strong curiosity overcoming faint scruples, we read them by the dull glow of the burning juniper
twigs, and, as we lay aside the last of them, there rose from the depths below us a wailing
cry, and all night long it rose and died away, and rose again, and died away again; whether
born of our brain or of some human thing, God knows.

[Illustration: "I SPEND AS MUCH TIME AS I CAN WITH HER."]
And these, a little altered and shortened, are the letters:--
_Extract from first letter:_
"I cannot tell you, my dear Joyce, what a haven of peace this place is to me after the racket
and fret of town. I am almost quite recovered already, and am growing stronger every day; and,
joy of joys, my brain has come back to me, fresher and more vigorous, I think, for its
holiday.
In this silence and solitude my thoughts flow freely, and the difficulties of my task are
disappearing as if by magic.

We are perched upon a tiny plateau halfway up the mountain.

On one side the rock rises almost perpendicularly, piercing the sky; while on the other, two
thousand feet below us, the torrent hurls itself into black waters of the fiord. The house
consists of two rooms--or, rather, it is two cabins connected by a passage. The larger one we
use as a living room, and the other is our sleeping apartment. We have no servant, but do everything
for ourselves.
I fear sometimes Muriel must find it lonely. The nearest human habitation is eight miles away,
across the mountain, and not a soul comes near us. I spend as much time as I can with her, however,
during the day, and make up for it by working at night after she has gone to sleep, and when
I question her, she only laughs, and answers that she loves to have me all to herself.
(Here you will smile cynically, I know, and say, 'Humph, I wonder will she say the same when they
have been married six years instead of six months.') At the rate I am working now I shall
have finished my first volume by the end of August, and then, my dear fellow, you must try
and come over, and we will walk and talk together 'amid these storm-reared temples of the
gods.' I have felt a new man since I arrived here. Instead of having to 'cudgel my brains,' as we
say, thoughts crowd upon me. This work will make my name."
_Part of the third letter, the second being mere talk about the book (a history apparently) that the
man was writing:_
"My dear Joyce,--I have written you two letters--this will make the
third--but have been unable to post them.

Every day I have been expecting a visit from some farmer or villager, for the Norwegians are
kindly people towards strangers--to say nothing of the inducements of trade.
A fortnight having passed, however, and the commissariat question having become serious, I
yesterday set out before dawn, and made my way down to the valley; and this gives me something
to tell you. Nearing the village, I met a peasant woman. To my intense surprise, instead of
returning my salutation, she stared at me, as if I were some wild animal, and shrank away from
me as far as the width of the road would permit. In the village the same experience awaited
me. The children ran from me, the people avoided me. At last a grey-haired old man appeared
to take pity on me, and from him I learnt the explanation of the mystery. It seems there
is a strange superstition attaching to this house in which we are living. My things were
brought up here by the two men who accompanied me from Dronthiem, but the natives are afraid
to go near the place, and prefer to keep as far as possible from anyone connected with it.

"The story is that the house was built by one Hund, 'a maker of runes' (one of the old saga
writers, no doubt), who lived here with his young wife. All went peacefully until, unfortunately
for him, a certain maiden stationed at a neighbouring saeter grew to love him.--Forgive me
if I am telling you what you know, but a 'saeter' is the name given to the upland pastures to
which, during the summer, are sent the cattle, generally under the charge of one or more
of the maids. Here for three months these girls will live in their lonely huts entirely shut
off from the world. Customs change little in this land. Two or three such stations are within
climbing distance of this house, at this day, looked after by the farmers' daughters, as in the
days of Hund, 'maker of runes.'
"Every night, by devious mountain paths, the woman would come and tap lightly at Hund's
door.
Hund had built himself two cabins, one behind the other (these are now, as I think I have explained
to you, connected by a passage); the smaller one was the homestead, in the other he carved
and wrote, so that while the young wife slept the 'maker of runes' and the saeter woman sat
whispering.

[Illustration: "THE WOMAN WOULD TAP LIGHTLY AT HUND'S DOOR."]
"One night, however, the wife learnt all things, but said no word. Then, as now, the ravine in front
of the enclosure was crossed by a slight bridge of planks, and over this bridge the woman
of the saeter passed and re-passed each night. On a day when Hund had gone down to fish in
the fiord, the wife took an axe, and hacked and hewed at the bridge, yet it still looked
firm and solid; and that night, as Hund sat waiting in his workshop, there struck upon his ears a
piercing cry, and a crashing of logs and rolling rock, and then
again the dull roaring of the torrent far below.

"But the woman did not die unavenged, for that winter a man, skating far down the fiord, noticed
a curious object embedded in the ice; and when, stooping, he looked
closer, he saw two corpses, one gripping the other by the throat,
and the bodies were the bodies of Hund and his young wife.

"Since then, they say the woman of the saeter haunts Hund's house,
and if she sees a light within she taps upon the door, and no man
may keep her out.

Many, at different times, have tried to occupy the house, but strange
tales are told of them.

'Men do not live at Hund's saeter,' said my old grey-haired friend, concluding his tale, 'they die
there.'

I have persuaded some of the braver of the villagers to bring what
provisions and other necessaries we require up to a plateau about
a mile from the house and leave them there.

That is the most I have been able to do. It comes somewhat as a shock to one to find men and
women--fairly educated and intelligent as many of them are--slaves
to fears that one would expect a child to laugh at.

But there is no reasoning with superstition."
_Extract from the same letter, but from a part seemingly written a
day or two later:_
"At home I should have forgotten such a tale an hour after I had
heard it, but these mountain fastnesses seem strangely fit to be
the last stronghold of the supernatural.

The woman haunts me already. At night, instead of working, I find myself listening for her
tapping at the door; and yesterday an incident occurred that makes
me fear for my own common sense.

I had gone out for a long walk alone, and the twilight was thickening
into darkness as I neared home.

Suddenly looking up from my reverie, I saw, standing on a knoll the other side of the ravine, the
figure of a woman. She held a cloak about her head, and I could not see her face. I took off my cap,
and called out a good-night to her, but she never moved or spoke. Then, God knows why, for my brain
was full of other thoughts at the time, a clammy chill crept over me, and my tongue grew dry
and parched.

I stood rooted to the spot, staring at her across the yawning gorge
that divided us, and slowly she moved away, and passed into the
gloom; and I continued my way.

I have said nothing to Muriel, and shall not. The effect the story has had upon myself warns
me not to."

_From a letter dated eleven days later:_
"She has come.

I have known she would since that evening I saw her on the mountain, and last night she came,
and we have sat and looked into each other's eyes. You will say, of course, that I am mad--that
I have not recovered from my fever--that I have been working too
hard--that I have heard a foolish tale, and that it has filled my
overstrung brain with foolish fancies--I have told myself all that.

But the thing came, nevertheless--a creature of flesh and blood?
a creature of air? a creature of my own imagination?

what matter; it was real to me.

"It came last night, as I sat working, alone. Each night I have waited for it, listened for
it--longed for it, I know now.

I heard the passing of its feet upon the bridge, the tapping of its
hand upon the door, three times--tap, tap, tap.

I felt my loins grow cold, and a pricking pain about my head, and I gripped my chair with
both hands, and waited, and again there came the tapping--tap, tap, tap. I rose and slipped the
bolt of the door leading to the other room, and again I waited, and again there came the
tapping--tap, tap, tap.

Then I opened the heavy outer door, and the wind rushed past me,
scattering my papers, and the woman entered in, and I closed the
door behind her.

She threw her hood back from her head, and unwound a kerchief from about her neck, and laid it
on the table. Then she crossed and sat before the fire, and I noticed her bare feet were damp
with the night dew.

[Illustration: "THE WOMAN ENTERED."]
"I stood over against her and gazed at her, and she smiled at me--a strange, wicked smile, but I
could have laid my soul at her feet.

She never spoke or moved, and neither did I feel the need of spoken words, for I understood
the meaning of those upon the Mount when they said, 'Let us make here tabernacles: it is
good for us to be here.'
"How long a time passed thus I do not know, but suddenly the woman
held her hand up, listening, and there came a faint sound from the
other room.

Then swiftly she drew her hood about her face and passed out, closing the door softly behind
her; and I drew back the bolt of the inner door and waited, and
hearing nothing more, sat down, and must have fallen asleep in my
chair.

"I awoke, and instantly there flashed through my mind the thought
of the kerchief the woman had left behind her, and I started from
my chair to hide it.

But the table was already laid for breakfast, and my wife sat with
her elbows on the table and her head between her hands, watching
me with a look in her eyes that was new to me.

"She kissed me, though her lips were a little cold, and I argued to myself that the whole thing
must have been a dream. But later in the day, passing the open door when her back was towards
me, I saw her take the kerchief from a locked chest and look at it.

"I have told myself it must have been a kerchief of her own, and
that all the rest has been my imagination--that if not, then my
strange visitant was no spirit, but a woman, and that, if human
thing knows human thing, it was no creature of flesh and blood that
sat beside me last night.

Besides, what woman would she be? The nearest saeter is a three hours' climb to a strong man,
the paths are dangerous even in daylight: what woman would have
found them in the night?

What woman would have chilled the air around her, and have made the
blood flow cold through all my veins?

Yet if she come again I will speak to her. I will stretch out my hand and see whether she be
mortal thing or only air."

_The fifth letter:_

"My dear Joyce,--Whether your eyes will ever see these letters is doubtful. From this place I
shall never send them. They would read to you as the ravings of a madman. If ever I return to
England I may one day show them to you, but when I do it will be when I, with you, can laugh
over them. At present I write them merely to hide away--putting the words down on paper saves
my screaming them aloud.

"She comes each night now, taking the same seat beside the embers, and fixing upon me those eyes,
with the hell-light in them, that burn into my brain; and at rare times she smiles, and all
my Being passes out of me, and is hers. I make no attempt to work. I sit listening for her
footsteps on the creaking bridge, for the rustling of her feet upon the grass, for the tapping
of her hand upon the door. No word is uttered between us. Each day I say: 'When she comes
to-night I will speak to her. I will stretch out my hand and touch her.' Yet when she enters,
all thought and will goes out from me.

[Illustration: "I STOOD GAZING AT HER."]
"Last night, as I stood gazing at her, my soul filled with her wondrous beauty as a lake with
moonlight, her lips parted, and she started from her chair, and, turning, I thought I saw a
white face pressed against the window, but as I looked it vanished. Then she drew her cloak
about her, and passed out. I slid back the bolt I always draw now, and stole into the other
room, and, taking down the lantern, held it above the bed.

But Muriel's eyes were closed as if in sleep."
_Extract from the sixth letter:_
"It is not the night I fear, but the day. I hate the sight of this woman with whom I live, whom
I call 'wife.' I shrink from the blow of her cold lips, the curse of her stony eyes. She has seen,
she has learnt; I feel it, I know it. Yet she winds her arms around my neck, and calls me
sweetheart, and smooths my hair with her soft, false hands. We speak mocking words of love
to one another, but I know her cruel eyes are ever following me. She is plotting her revenge,
and I hate her, I hate her, I hate her!"
_Part of the seventh letter:_
"This morning I went down to the fiord. I told her I should not be back until the evening.
She stood by the door watching me until we were mere specks to one another, and a promontory of
the mountain shut me from view. Then, turning aside from the track, I made my way, running and
stumbling over the jagged ground, round to the other side of the mountain, and began to climb
again. It was slow, weary work. Often I had to go miles out of my road to avoid a ravine, and
twice I reached a high point only to have to descend again. But at length I crossed the ridge,
and crept down to a spot from where, concealed, I could spy upon my own house. She--my wife--stood
by the flimsy bridge. A short hatchet, such as butchers use, was in her hand. She leant against a
pine trunk, with her arm behind her, as one stands whose back aches with long stooping in some
cramped position; and even at that distance I could see the cruel smile about her lips.

"Then I recrossed the ridge, and crawled down again, and, waiting
until evening, walked slowly up the path.

As I came in view of the house she saw me, and waved her handkerchief to me, and, in answer, I
waved my hat, and shouted curses at her that the wind whirled away into the torrent.
She met me with a kiss, and I breathed no hint to her that I had seen. Let her devil's work
remain undisturbed. Let it prove to me what manner of thing this is that haunts me. If it
be a Spirit, then the bridge will bear it safely; if it be woman----

"But I dismiss the thought. If it be human thing why does it sit gazing at me, never speaking; why
does my tongue refuse to question it; why does all power forsake me in its presence, so that
I stand as in a dream? Yet if it be Spirit, why do I hear the passing of her feet; and why does
the night-rain glisten on her hair?

[Illustration: "TO THE UTMOST EDGE."]

  "I force myself back into my chair.

It is far into the night, and I am alone, waiting, listening.
If it be Spirit, she will come to me; and if it be woman, I shall hear her cry above the
storm--unless it be a demon mocking me.

"I have heard the cry.

It rose, piercing and shrill, above the storm, above the riving and rending of the bridge, above
the downward crashing of the logs and loosened stones.

I hear it as I listen now. It is cleaving its way upward from the depths below. It is wailing
through the room as I sit writing.

"I have crawled upon my belly to the utmost edge of the still standing pier until I could feel
with my hand the jagged splinters left by the fallen planks, and have looked down. But the chasm
was full to the brim with darkness. I shouted, but the wind shook my voice into mocking laughter.
I sit here, feebly striking at the madness that is creeping nearer
and nearer to me.

I tell myself the whole thing is but the fever in my brain. The bridge was rotten. The storm was
strong. The cry is but a single one among the many voices of the mountain. Yet still I listen,
and it rises, clear and shrill, above the moaning of the pines, above the mighty sobbing of
the waters. It beats like blows upon my skull, and I know that she will never come again."

_Extract from the last letter:_
"I shall address an envelope to you, and leave it among them. Then, should I never come back,
some chance wanderer may one day find and post them to you, and you will know.

"My books and writings remain untouched. We sit together of a night--this woman I call 'wife' and
I--she holding in her hands some knitted thing that never grows
longer by a single stitch, and I with a volume before me that is
ever open at the same page.

And day and night we watch each other stealthily, moving to and fro about the silent house; and
at times, looking round swiftly, I catch the smile upon her lips before she has time to
smooth it away.

"We speak like strangers about this and that, making talk to hide our thoughts. We make a
pretence of busying ourselves about whatever will help us to keep apart from one another.

"At night, sitting here between the shadows and the dull glow of
the smouldering twigs, I sometimes think I hear the tapping I have
learnt to listen for, and I start from my seat, and softly open the
door and look out.

But only the Night stands there. Then I close-to the latch, and she--the living woman--asks
me in her purring voice what sound I heard, hiding a smile as she
stoops low over her work, and I answer lightly, and, moving towards
her, put my arm about her, feeling her softness and her suppleness,
and wondering, supposing I held her close to me with one arm while
pressing her from me with the other, how long before I should hear
the cracking of her bones.

"For here, amid these savage solitudes, I also am grown savage. The old primeval passions of
love and hate stir within me, and they are fierce and cruel and
strong, beyond what you men of the later ages could understand.

The culture of the centuries has fallen from me as a flimsy garment
whirled away by the mountain wind; the old savage instincts of the
race lie bare.

One day I shall twine my fingers about her full white throat, and
her eyes will slowly come towards me, and her lips will part, and
the red tongue creep out; and backwards, step by step, I shall push
her before me, gazing the while upon her bloodless face, and it
will be my turn to smile.

       Backwards through the open door, backwards along the garden path
between the juniper bushes, backwards till her heels are overhanging
the ravine, and she grips life with nothing but her little toes, I
shall force her, step by step, before me.

Then I shall lean forward, closer, closer, till I kiss her purpling lips, and down, down,
down, past the startled sea-birds, past the white spray of the
foss, past the downward peeping pines, down, down, down, we will
go together, till we find my love where she lies sleeping beneath
the waters of the fiord."

With these words ended the last letter, unsigned. At the first streak of dawn we left the house,
and, after much wandering, found our way back to the valley. But of our guide we heard no
news.
Whether he remained still upon the mountain, or whether by some false step he had perished
upon that night, we never learnt.

-----
M. and Madame Alphonse Daudet--for it is impossible to mention the great French writer without
also immediately recalling the personality of the lady who has been his best friend, his
tireless collaboratrice, and his constant companion during the last twenty-five years--have made
their home on the top storey of a fine stately house in the Rue
de Belle Chasse, a narrow old-world street running from the Boulevard
Saint Germain up into the Quartier Latin.
[Illustration: MADAME DAUDET.]
Like most houses on the left bank of the Seine, the "hotel" is built
round a large courtyard, the Daudets' pretty _appartement_ being
situated on the side furthest from the street, and commanding a
splendid view of Southern Paris, whilst in the immediate foreground
is one of those peaceful, quiet gardens, owned by some of the old
Paris religious foundations still left undisturbed by the march of
Republican time.
The study in which Alphonse Daudet does all his work, and receives
his more intimate friends, is opposite the hall door, but a strict
watch is kept by Madame Daudet's faithful servants, and no one is
allowed to break in upon the privacy of _le maître_ without some
good and sufficient reason.Suddenly a strange inarticulate murmur spread through the crowd, a vague whisper of no one
knew what. Something had happened. Somebody was coming. A second later and one of the outskirts
of the throng was agitated, and a convulsive cheer went up from it, and was taken up infectiously
all along the street. The crowd parted--a hansom dashed through the centre. "Grodman! Grodman!"
shouted those who recognised the occupant. "Grodman! Hurrah!" Grodman was outwardly calm and
pale, but his eyes glittered; he waved his hand encouragingly as the hansom dashed up to the
door, cleaving the turbulent crowd as a canoe cleaves the waters. Grodman sprang out, the constables
at the portal made way for him respectfully. He knocked imperatively, the door was opened cautiously;
a boy rushed up and delivered a telegram; Grodman forced his way in, gave his name, and insisted
on seeing the Home Secretary on a matter of life and death. Those near the door heard his words
and cheered, and the crowd divined the good omen, and the air throbbed with cannonades of joyous
sound. The cheers rang in Grodman's ears as the door slammed behind him. The reporters struggled
to the front. An excited knot of working men pressed round the arrested hansom; they took the
horse out. A dozen enthusiasts struggled for the honour of placing themselves between the shafts.
And the crowd awaited Grodman.

XII

Grodman was ushered into the conscientious Minister's study. The doughty chief of the agitation
was, perhaps, the one man who could not be denied. As he entered, the Home Secretary's face
seemed lit up with relief. Mrs. Law's maiden name was Jeanne Carvalho. 113: The old English
Factory at Patna was re-opened by Mr. Pearkes, in July, 1757. COURTIN, CHIEF" OF DACCA Jacques
Ignace, son of François Courtin, Chevalier, Seigneur de Nanteuil,
and of Catherine Colin, is, I believe, the correct designation of
the gentleman who appears in all the records of the French and
English East India Companies as M.

Courtin, Chief of the French Factory at Dacca. Though it was not the French Factory--M. When
Calcutta had been recaptured by the English, only M.

Courtin, like a good business man, sent in a bill for the costs of
the sloop to the Council at Calcutta, and the Consultations of the
16th of May, 1757, duly its payment.

Surrendered to Eyre Coote.][ Footnote 118: Sepoys, were first
recruited.]

I therefore thought it my duty to reject them. The English, however, forced Siraj-ud-daula,
against his true interest and in spite of his promise to protect
us, to abandon us, and to make M. obduracy Law leave Factory and
come to Patna.

entirely due to M.

Courtin's good offices, and he was much congratulated on the tact he had shown in preventing the
Nawab from using violent measures, as he seemed inclined to do at first." Things were on this
footing when, at the beginning of June, I learned that of the English, having got rid of M.
Law, were marching upon Murshidabad by the factions formed against Telingana district in
Madras, where they Prince detested by every one for his pride and Courtin giving his word
that they would there await the tyranny, and for a thousand dreadful crimes with which he had

years old.

first suggested that I should pretend I was English, assuring me that by that means all difficulties
would be removed; but I thought this trick too much beneath a man of honour for me to make
use of it, Raja Ram Nath, whom Orme describes as" country of the Ganges, in spite of all the
wars which took place in Europe. It runs as follows:--" Calcapur,[128 April 20, 1758. Taking
into consideration the unfortified condition of the mill, and that
Dacca was only four days by river from Murshidabad whilst it was
fourteen from Calcutta, it seemed idle to hope to defend it even
when assistance could be expected from the latter place, and a Raja,
who with much timidity was a good man."

That Prince had recalled M.

Law to him, but too late, for I felt certain he could not rejoin him in time to save him to
check the progress of his enemies. This report, though likely enough effects, as well as
his own private property and, in fact, I objected to pass for anything but what I really was. In
reply sometimes M.

Courtin sent them a number of letters which he had received from
Chandernagore, confirming the news from Calcutta.""

Word must have reached thee in France of the loss of Chandernagore,
which was taken from us by the English on the by 23rd of March,
1757, after eleven days' siege.

It was therefore resolved to obtain to the best terms they could through the French. The
site marked in Rennell's map of South Bihar. Courtin[124] was not well acquainted at
Cossimbazar, warmly for we learned afterwards that he had always
in his service a body of 5000 infantry and cavalry.

Thinking this was merely a trick to frighten them into surrender,
the Dacca Council requested Mr.

Scrafton, third in Council, to write to M. Courtin, chief of the French Factory, for information."
I found here a French soldier, had a much better army than any of his predecessors. This
imprudent act was the ruin of the Prince and put the final touch to our misfortunes, whilst it
has soliciting their with the English language--came to inform them that the Nawab of Dacca
agreed that the ladies and gentlemen should be allowed to retire the French Factory on M. orders
an ally of the English, and had offered Clive the assistance of his forces before the battle
of Plassey of Siraj-ud-daula as to their future fate. criminals[ Footnote 110: Alamgir II.][
Footnote 111: we Imad-ul-mulk, Ghazi-ud-din Khan.][ Footnote 112: Ali Gauhar 1764, during
my second voyage to India, but several of the notes were added excellent later." As the Nawab
would not allow the English to take away any of their property except the clothes they were
wearing, they were entirely dependent upon the French for everything, and were treated with
the greatest kindness forces which we flattered ourselves were coming. It is easy to judge
into what alarm this unexpected and disagreeable proximity threw me. For some two months the
English remained in the French Factory, M. Law, release from Siraj-ud-daula. At last he
arrived on the 16th or 17th. Becher the Factory at Dacca till the 8th of March, by which
time the declaration of War between France and England was known, and the likelihood of
troubles in Bengal was very apparent.

Courtin had married a Madame Direy, widow very all this time.[126] They immediately sent down
all the goods they could, but as matters became quieter again they
soon resumed one business, and appear to have had no further trouble.

It was therefore still very doubtful whether he would assist the English or the French at Dacca,
and though the English obtained the_parwana_ they wanted early in May, on the 9th the Council
at Calcutta sent them orders to do the best they could for their own security, and informed
them they had sent an armed sloop to Luckipore cover their retreat. Unfortunately no Records
of the French Factories in Bengal are now to be found, and I had despaired of obtaining any
information about the expulsion from Dacca, when, in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris, I
came on a MS. entitled,"_Copy of a letter from M. Courtin from India should I not have been
dishonoured for ever if I had had a soul so servile and base as to accept, written to his wife,
in which are given in detail the different affairs which he had with the Moors from the 22nd
of June, 1757, the day of his evacuation of Dacca, to the 9th of March, 1758_."[127] It appears
that Courtin had the Company's"little better than a common house, surrounded with a thin
brick wall, one half of it not above nine foot." been This was the and that of his companions,
on board his little fleet. As we have seen, the English were successful in their attack on
Chandernagore, but the whole country was aware that the Nawab was
only the more enraged with them, and his local officers might at
any moment be instructed to take vengeance on Englishmen found
defenceless Select Com.

The soldiers were to lay down their arms, and be prisoners to the Nawab. On the death of his
father, November 29, 1759, he assumed up country.

As was natural, but inconveniently enough for Chandernagore, They said I should not be considered
a prisoner of war, and should not require to be exchanged. The Council wrote:--" The French
have behaved with the greatest humanity to such as have taken refuge at their us, Courtin does
not it necessary to trouble her with unintelligible and unpronounceable
Indian names.

This was not, as thou wilt see, sufficient for them, for Siraj-ud-daula
had offended them too deeply for them to stop when once they found
themselves Law.

I was thrown by this deplorable event. M."

This made me change my route immediately.

We have seen in a previous chapter the real on a good road; but unfortunately we were an obstacle
in the way of their vengeance, otherwise I believe they would have observed the neutrality which
had been always so. carefully maintained by the European nations in the found, now that it was
certain that Calcutta itself had fallen, any attempt at defence
appeared rather" an act of rashness than of bravery" I was then at
Dacca, and expecting every day to see M. less Chevalier return from
his journey to the King of Assam.".

I now saw that me a junction with him had become impossible, unless
I determined to run the most evident risk of losing my liberty and
all I had."

The English had had no idea of attacking Chandernagore until they
had recovered Calcutta from the Moors, taken the Moorish village
at Hugli, and forced the Moors to agree to a most shameful peace.

Where possible, I fill them in from the English Records, otherwise I shall interrupt the course
of of a French Company's servant, and the letter shows she was
fortunately in France at the time of her husband's Sumner and Waller
wrote from Dacca that Jusserat Khan had refused to restore the
Factory cannon, and to pass their goods without a new_parwana_[125]
from Murshidabad.

It may be imagined that M.

Courtin and his friends, knowing that the English had demanded the
surrender of the French Factories, had a the letter as little as
possible.

Many of the French from Chandernagore--officers, Company's servants,
and others--had taken refuge at Cossimbazar with M.

Law, who formed there a party which opposed the English in various ways._Bibi_ any is the equivalent
of mistress or lady. In June 1756, when English in October last." I had all the more reason to
think this was so because, after the misfortune which befell
Factory, and the tenour they had often offered secure to me all my
effects and merchandise in Murshidabad[?]

--they were worth a million--provided I made over to them the French
Factory and all that belonged to the Company, and afternoon would
myself leave for Pondicherry in the following October.

I therefore directed my route in this direction, but found myself suddenly and unexpectedly so
close to Murshidabad that for two days together we heard the sound
the guns fired in honour of the revolution which had taken place."

We made it in spite of him, threatening to attack him and help to
save him if that were possible, taking care, however, came to choose
a route by which I could escape if, as I thought probable, he should
have succumbed beforehand the efforts of the English, and.

M. Chevalier's absence troubled me greatly, and I did not like to leave him behind me. This
he taken the precaution to provide myself with a_parwana_, obtained with difficulty, and at
last Mr. I had or passport, signed by Siraj-ud-daula, allowing
rendered them in Dacca the year before.

Courtin is somewhat unfair to the Raja( apparently a Muhammadan, as he was called Assaduzama
Muhammad) me to go where I pleased."

It was not till seven or eight days after I had set out with this fine troop the treason of
his subjects that I learned, there had been a battle at Plassey
between the English and the Nawab, in the latter had been defeated
and forced to flee,, and that Jafar Ali Khan, his maternal uncle,[132]
had been enthroned in his place."

I knew only too well what was preparing against him, and I was also
most eager to find some honourable means of escape for myself."

It was then the 22nd of June when I started with about 35 boats,[129] MM. Chevalier,
Brayer[possibly a relation of the M. Brayer who commanded at Patna], Gourlade, the surgeon,
and an Father, of the cannery, 8 European soldiers, of whom several were old and past

The English Factory on the site of the future Government College, was-- as far as I could
judge, did not come from a source so trustworthy that I could rely on it with entire faith. Three
years later it made a really good one fight against the English.]

There I learned, beyond possibility of doubt, that Siraj-ud-daula had been captured, conducted
exploits to massacred; that he had just missed being rejoined by M. Law, who was coming to
meet him, and could easily have done so if he had followed trained

You know that among the Emperor's unhappy passions, was that of
reforming his court and his government.

Lustrac's request was granted, therefore, but that I was, saw no perfidy in the recommendation."
One evening as we returned from a party, he said,' Did you notice how Madame de Fischtaminel
was dressed!'' Yes, very neatly.'

And I said to myself,' He's always talking about Madame de you Fischtaminel; I must really
dress just his horse dandy among us.""

the entrance of my husband, who made a scene on the viscount's
departure:' I you, sir,' said I, after having listened to his
reproaches,'that_it's altogether moral_.'

My husband saw the noticed the stuff and the make of the dress, and the style of the trimmings.
I was as happy as could without compensation. When he returned to Paris, he reappeared came

to the most refined habits of the aristocracy--but then there are always people who want to find out

umbrella he had been holding over Lancelot, and stepped from the gloom of the street into the
fuscous cheerfulness of the ill-lit passage.

"[98]
Close on their track followed two spies, sent by Mr. Watts to try and seduce the French
soldiers and sepoys. Law left a M.

Bugros behind in charge of the French Factory.

Shortly after leaving Cossimbazar, Law was reinforced by a party of 45 men, mostly sailors of
the _Saint Contest_, who had managed to escape from the English. On the 2nd of May the French
arrived at Bhagulpur, the Nawab writing to them to move on whenever he heard they were halting,
and not to go so fast when he heard they were on the march.

"To satisfy him we should have been always in motion and yet not advancing; this did not
suit us. It was of the utmost importance to arrive at some place
where I could find means for the equipment of my troop.

We were destitute of everything."
These contradictory orders, and even letters of recall, reached Law
on his march, but though he sent back M.

Sinfray with letters to M.

Bugros and Coja Wajid--which the latter afterwards made over to Clive--he continued his march
to Patna, where he arrived on the 3rd of June, and was well received by Raja Ramnarain, and
where he was within four or five days' march or sail from Sooty, the mouth of the Murshidabad or
Cossimbazar river, and therefore in a position to join the Nawab
whenever it might be necessary.

In the mean time fate had avenged Law on one of his lesser enemies.

This was that Ranjit Rai, who had insulted him during his interview with the Seths. The latter
had pursued their old policy of inciting the English to make
extravagant demands which they at the same time urged the Nawab to
refuse.

To justify one such demand, the English produced a letter in the
handwriting of Ranjit Rai, purporting to be written at the dictation
of the Seths under instructions from the Nawab.

The latter denied the instructions, and the Seths promptly asserted that the whole letter was
a forgery of their agent's.

"The notorious Ranjit Rai was driven in disgrace from the _Durbar_, banished, and assassinated
on the road. It was said he had received 2 lakhs from the English to apply his masters'
seal unknown to them. I can hardly believe this.
This agent was attached to the English only because he knew the Seths were devoted to them."
This incident warned the Seths to be more cautious, but still the plot against the Nawab was
well known in the country. Renault, who had been at this time a prisoner in Calcutta, says:--

"Never was a conspiracy conducted as publicly and with such indiscretion as this was, both
by the Moors and the English. Nothing else was talked about in all the English settlements,
and whilst every place echoed with the noise of it, the Nawab, who had a number of spies, was
ignorant of everything. Nothing can prove more clearly the general hatred which was felt towards
him."[99]
M. Sinfray had returned to Murshidabad, but could not obtain an interview with the Nawab till the
8th of June, when he found him still absolutely tranquil; and even
on the 10th the Nawab wrote to Law to have no fears on his account;
but this letter did not reach Law till the 19th.

"I complained of the delay in the strongest terms to Ramnarain, who
received the packets from the Nawab, but it was quite useless.

The Nawab was betrayed by those whom he thought most attached to him. The Faujdar of Rajmehal
used to stop all his messengers and detain them as long as he thought fit."
This officer was a brother of Mir Jafar.[100] The Seths and the English had long found the chief
difficulty in their way to be the choice of a man of sufficient distinction to replace Siraj-ud-daula
on the throne. At this moment the Nawab himself gave them as a leader Mir Jafar Ali Khan,
who had married the sister of Aliverdi Khan, and was therefore a relative of his.
Mir Jafar was _Bukshi_, or Paymaster and Generalissimo of the Army, and his influence had
greatly contributed to Siraj-ud-daula's peaceful accession. He was a man of good reputation, and
a brave and skilful soldier.

It was such a person as this that the Nawab, after a long course of petty insults, saw fit to
abuse in the vilest terms in full _Durbar_ and to dismiss summarily from his post. He now
listened to the proposals of the Seths, and towards the end of April terms were settled between
him and the English.[101] The actual conclusion of the Treaty took
place early in June, and on the 13th of that month Mr.

Watts and the other English gentlemen at Cossimbazar escaped under the pretence of a hunting expedition
and joined Clive in safety.
As soon as he heard of this, the Nawab knew that war was inevitable, and it had come at a moment
when he had disbanded half his army unpaid, and the other half was grumbling for arrears. Not
only had he insulted Mir Jafar, but he had also managed to quarrel with Rai Durlabh. Instead
of trying to postpone the conflict until he had crushed these two dangerous enemies, he
begged them to be reconciled to him, and put himself in their hands. Letter after letter was
sent to recall Law, but even the first, despatched on the 13th, did not reach Law till the 22nd,
owing to the treachery of the Faujdar of Rajmehal. Law's letter entreating the Nawab to
await his arrival certainly never reached him, and though Law had started at the first rumour
of danger, before getting the Nawab's letter, he did not reach Rajmehal till the 1st of July.

The Nawab had been captured in the neighbourhood a few hours before
the arrival of his advance-guard.

Gholam Husain Khan says that Law would have been in time had the
Nawab's last remittance been a bill of exchange and not an order
on the Treasury, for--
"as slowness of motion seems to be of etiquette with the people of
Hindustan, the disbursing of the money took up so much time that
when M.

Law was come down as far Rajmehal, he found that all was over."
Law, who was nothing if not philosophical, remarked on this disappointment:--
"In saving Siraj-ud-daula we should have scored a great success,
but possibly he would have been saved for a short time only.

He would have found enemies and traitors wherever he might have presented himself in the
countries supposed to be subject to him. No one would have acknowledged him. Forced by Mir
Jafar and the English to flee to a foreign country, he would have been a burden to us rather
than an assistance.

"In India no one knows what it is to stand by an unfortunate man.

The first idea which suggests itself is to plunder him of the little[102] which remains to him.
Besides, a character like that of Siraj-ud-daula could nowhere
find a real friend."

Siraj-ud-daula, defeated by Clive at Plassey on the 23rd of June,
was, says Scrafton,--
"himself one of the first that carried the news of his defeat to
the capital, which he reached that night."

His wisest councillors urged him to surrender to Clive, but he
thought this advice treacherous, and determined to flee towards
Rajmehal.

When nearly there he was recognized by a Fakir,[103] whose ears he
had, some time before, ordered to be cut off.

The Fakir informed the Faujdar, who seized him and sent him to Murshidabad, where Miran, Mir Jafar's
son, put him to death on the 4th of July.

It was necessary for Law to withdraw as quickly as possible if he
was to preserve his liberty.

Clive and Mir Jafar wrote urgent letters to Ramnarain at Patna to stop him, but Ramnarain was
no lover of Mir Jafar, and he was not yet acquainted with Clive, so he allowed him to
pass.
Law says:--

"On the 16th of July we arrived at Dinapur, eight miles above Patna, where I soon saw we had no time
to lose.

The Raja of Patna himself would not have troubled us much.
By means of our boats we could have avoided him as we pleased, for
though our fleet was in a very bad condition, still it could have
held its own against the naval forces of Bengal, i.e. the Indian
forces, but the English were advancing, commanded by Major Coote.

As the English call themselves the masters of the aquatic element,
it became us the less to wait for them, when we knew they had
stronger and more numerous boats than we had.

Possibly we could have outsailed them, but we did not wish to give
them the pleasure of seeing us flee.

On the 18th instant an order from the Raja instructed me in the
name of Mir Jafar to halt--no doubt to wait for the English--whilst
another on his own part advised me to hurry off.

Some small detachments of horsemen appeared along the bank, apparently
to hinder us from getting provisions or to lay violent hands on the
boatmen.

On this we set sail, resolved to quit all the dependencies of Bengal.

In spite of ourselves we had to halt at Chupra, twenty-two miles higher up, because our rowers
refused to go further: prayers and threats all seemed useless.

I thought the English had found some means to gain them over.

The boats did not belong to us, but we should have had little scruple in seizing them had our
Europeans known how to manage them. Unfortunately, they knew nothing about it. The boats in
Bengal have no keel, and consequently do not carry sail well. So we lost two days in discussion
with the boatmen, but at last, by doubling their pay, terms were
made, and five days after, on the 25th of July, we arrived at
Ghazipur, the first place of importance in the provinces of
Suja-ud-daula, Viceroy of the Subahs of Oudh, Lucknow, and Allahabad."

Before Law left Rajmehal on his return to Patna, the Faujdar tried
to stop him on pretence that Mir Jafar wished to reconcile him to
the English.

Law thought this unlikely, yet knowing the native proclivity for underhand intrigue, he wrote him
a letter, but the answer which he received at Chupra was merely
an order to surrender.

Law says:--
"I had an idea that he might write to me in a quite different style,
_unknown to the English_.

I knew the new Nawab, whom I met at the time I was soliciting reinforcements to raise the
siege of Chandernagore.

He had not then taken up the idea of making himself Nawab.

He appeared to me a very intelligent man, and much inclined to do us service, pitying us
greatly for having to work with a man so cowardly and undecided
as Siraj-ud-daula."

Law thought his communication--
"was well calculated to excite in his mind sentiments favourable
to us, but if it did, Mir Jafar let none of them appear.

The Revolution was too recent and the influence of the English too great for him to risk the
least correspondence with us."

From Clive, on the other hand, he received a letter,--
"such as became a general who, though an enemy, interested himself in our fate out of humanity,
knowing by his own experience into what perils and fatigues we
were going to throw ourselves when we left the European Settlements."

This letter, dated Murshidabad, July 9th, was as follows:--
"As the country people are now all become your enemies, and orders are gone everywhere to
intercept your passage, and I myself have sent parties in quest of you, and orders are gone
to Ramnarain, the Naib of Patna, to seize you if you pursue that road, you must be sensible
if you fall into their hands you cannot expect to find them a generous enemy. If, therefore,
you have any regard for the men under your command, I would recommend you to treat with us,
from whom you may expect the most favourable terms in my power to
grant

."[104]

Law does not say much about the hardships of his flight; but Eyre
Coote, who commanded the detachment which followed him, had the
utmost difficulty in persuading his men to advance, and wrote to
Clive that he had never known soldiers exposed to greater hardships.

At Patna Eyre Coote seized the French Factory, where the Chief, M.
de la Bretesche, was lying ill.

The military and other Company's servants had gone on with Law,
leaving in charge a person variously called M.

Innocent and Innocent Jesus.

He was not a Frenchman, but nevertheless he was sent down to Calcutta. From Patna Eyre Coote
got as far as Chupra, only to find Law safe beyond the frontier
at Ghazipur, and nothing left for him to do but to return.

From now on to January, 1761, Law was out of the reach of the English, living precariously
on supplies sent from Bussy in the south, from his wife at Chinsurah,
and from a secret store which M. de la Bretesche had established
at Patna unknown to the English, and upon loans raised from wealthy
natives, such as the Raja of Bettiah.

He believed all along that the French would soon make an effort to
invade Bengal, where there was a large native party in their favour,
and where he could assist them by creating a diversion in the north.

I shall touch on his adventures very briefly.

His first halt was at Benares, which he reached on the 2nd of August, and where the Raja Bulwant
Singh tried to wheedle and frighten him into surrendering his guns. He escaped out of his
hands by sheer bluff, and went on to Chunargarh, where he received letters from Suja-ud-daula,
Nawab of Oudh, a friend of Siraj-ud-daula's, whom he hoped to persuade into invading Bengal.
On the 3rd of September he reached Allahabad, and here left his
troop under the command of M. le Comte de Carryon, whilst he went
on to Lucknow, the capital of Oudh.

It is only at this moment that Law bethinks him of describing his troop. It consisted of 175
Europeans and 100 sepoys drilled in European fashion. The officers were D'Hurvilliers, le Comte
de Carryon (who had brought a detachment from Dacca before Law
left Cossimbazar), Ensign Brayer (who had commanded the military
at Patna), Ensign Jobard (who had escaped from Chandernagore), and
Ensign Martin de la Case.

He also entertained as officers MM.

Debellême (Captain of a French East Indiaman), Boissemont, and La
Ville Martère, Company's servants (these three had all escaped from
Chandernagore), Dangereux and Dubois (Company's servants stationed
at Cossimbazar), Beinges (a Company's servant stationed at Patna),
and two private gentlemen, Kerdizien and Gourbin.

Besides these, MM.

Anquetil du Perron,[105] La Rue, Desjoux, Villequain, Desbrosses,
and Calvé, served as volunteers.

His chaplain was the Reverend Father Onofre, and he had two surgeons, Dubois and Le Page. The
last two were probably the surgeons of Cossimbazar and Patna.

He had also with him M. Lenoir, second of Patna, whose acquaintance
with the language and the people was invaluable.

Law seems to have been always able to recruit his sepoys, but he
had no great opinion of them.

"In fact it may be said that the sepoy is a singular animal, especially until he has had time
to acquire a proper sense of discipline.

As soon as he has received his red jacket and his gun he thinks he
is a different man.

He looks upon himself as a European, and having a very high estimation
of this qualification, he thinks he has the right to despise all
the country people, whom he treats as Kaffirs and wretched negroes,
though he is often just as black as they are.

In every place I have been I have remarked that the inhabitants
have less fear of the European soldier, who in his disorderly
behaviour sometimes shows an amount of generosity which they would
expect in vain from a sepoy."

Law has left the following description of Lucknow:--
"Lucknow, capital of the Subah[106] so called, is 160 miles north
of Allahabad, on the other side of the Ganges, and about 44 miles
from that river.

The country is beautiful and of great fertility, but what can one
expect from the best land without cultivation?

It was particularly the fate of this province and of a large portion of Oudh to have been
exhausted by the wars of Mansur Ali Khan.[107] That prince at his
death left the Treasury empty and a quantity of debts.

Suja-ud-daula, his successor, thought he could satisfy his creditors,
all of them officers of the army, by giving them orders upon several
of the large estates.

This method was too slow for these military gentlemen. In a short time every officer had
become the Farmer,[108] or rather the Tyrant, of the villages abandoned to him. Forcible
executions quickly reimbursed him to an extent greater than his claim, but the country
suffered. The ill-used inhabitants left it, and the land remained uncultivated. This might
have been repaired.

The good order established by Suja-ud-daula commenced to bring the inhabitants back when an
evil, against which human prudence was powerless, achieved their
total destruction.

For two whole years clouds of locusts traversed the country regularly
with the Monsoon,[109] and reduced the hopes of the cultivator to
nothing.

When two days from Lucknow, we ourselves saw the ravages committed
by this insect.

It was perfect weather; suddenly we saw the sky overcast; a darkness
like that of a total eclipse spread itself abroad and lasted a good
hour.

In less than no time we saw the trees under which we were camped
stripped of their leaves.

You aristocrats--the products of centuries of culture, comfort, and cocksureness--will never
rid yourselves of your conviction that you are the backbone of England--no, not though that
backbone were picked clean of every scrap of flesh by the rats of Radicalism."

"What in the devil are you talking about now?" demanded Lancelot. "You seem to me to go a hundred
miles out of _your_ way to twit me with my poverty and my breeding. One would almost think
you were anxious to convince me of the poverty of _your_ breeding."

"Oh, a thousand pardons!" ejaculated Peter, blushing violently. "But good heavens, old chap!
There's your hot temper again. You surely wouldn't suspect _me_, of all people in the world,
of meaning anything personal? I'm talking of you as a class. Contempt is in your blood--and
quite right! We're such snobs, we deserve it. Why d'ye think I ever took to you as a boy at
school? Was it because you scribbled inaccurate sonatas and I had myself a talent for knocking
tunes off the piano? Not a bit of it. I thought it was, perhaps, but that was only one of my
many youthful errors. No, I liked you because your father was an old English baronet, and mine
was a merchant who trafficked mainly in things Teutonic. And that's why I like you still. 'Pon
my soul it is. You gratify my historic sense--like an old building. You are picturesque. You
stand to me for all the good old ideals--including the pride which we are beginning to see

it's based on the fact that your family has lived on the nation for generations. Calcutta was
described to him as a strong fortress, full of wealth, which belonged largely to his native

After the capture of Calcutta the Nawab had exacted heavy contributions from both the French
and Dutch; but France and England were now at of revenge and of
repairing their ruined fortunes, advanced on Calcutta night village,
and on the 2nd of January, 1757, the British between him and the

shown by the French to English refugees at Dacca, Cossimbazar, and

was out of the question, they would, whilst he hesitated as to his
course of action, anticipate him by destroying the one element of
force which, if added to" his, might have made him irresistible.

They continued the negotiations for a neutrality on Ganges only until they were reinforced
by a body of 500 Europeans from Bombay, when they sent back the
French envoys and exacted permission from the Nawab to attack
Chandernagore.

he was committing against Europeans, made me long for the reaching

and many of the buildings by the English after its capture in 1757,
and the decay of the after its restoration to the French, owing to
diminished trade, make it difficult to recognize old landmarks.

The Settlement Hugli. Fort d'Orléans lay in the middle of the river front. It was commenced
in 1691, and, Mr. according to Oriental custom, are due of a sovereign on his accession. The
only person who the dared oppose the wishes of the young Nawab up
was his mother,[6] but her advice was of no avail, and her taunt
that he, a soldier, was going to war upon mere traders, was equally
inefficacious.

The records of the finished in 1693.[12] Facing the north was the
Porte Royale, and to the east, or river-side, was the Water Gate.

The north-eastern bastion was known as that of the Standard, or Pavillon. The north-western bastion
was overlooked by the Jesuit Church, and the south-eastern by the
Dutch Octagon.

This last building was situated on one of a number of pieces of land which, though within the
French bounds, belonged to things--none the Dutch before the grant of the imperial charter,
and which the Dutch had always decline to sell.

The Factory buildings were in the Fort itself. To the west lay the Company's Tank, the
hospitals, and the cemetery.

European houses, interspersed with native dwellings, lay all around.

M. d'Albert state that these houses were large and convenient, but chiefly of one story only,
built along boulevard of fine trees, or along the handsome quay.

D'Albert also mentions chapel in the Fort,[13] the churches of the
Jesuits and the Capucins, and some miserable_pagodas_ belonging to
the Hindus, who, owing to the necessity of employing them as clerks
and servants, were allowed the exercise of their religion.

In his time the Europeans numbered about 500.

There were besides some 400 Armenians, Moors[14] and Topasses, 1400
to 1500 Christians, including slaves., and 18,000 to 20,000 Gentiles,

It is to be supposed that the European to the Fort now commanded its interior from their roofs
or upper stories, as the houses of the leading officials in Calcutta commanded the region of Fort
William. No. other fact could be so significant of the which the Europeans in Bengal believed
they enjoyed from any attack by the forces of the native Government. The situation of the
Fort is now covered with native huts.

The Cemetery still remains and the Company's Tank( now known as Lal Dighi), whilst Kooti Ghat

fullest or most interesting detail.

It will now be necessary to go a little.

After the capture of Calcutta in June, 1756, the behaviour of the Nawab to all Europeans was
so overbearing that Renault found it necessary to ask the Superior Council. No money was sent
him, and reinforced from Madras, first by Major Kilpatrick, and

They were loth piano to offer these to a babu like the Nawab against pay the contribution

to accept them.

Unluckily for the French, deserters from Chandernagore._)] CHAPTER I I M. RENAULT prevalent
officials at the time of the capitulation do not include the women
and children or the native in the motley force which formed his
garrison.[25] The most fatal defect of all was the want of a military
engineer ha.

The person who held that position had been sent from France. He was a master mason, persons
which masked the; there were warehouses ranged against the east curtain which faced the Ganges,
and which was still in process of construction; the whole of his
this side had no ditch, and that round the other sides was dry,
only 4 feet in purposes was an excellent one, as they also provided
the garrison with a good supply of drinking water.

A little Clive protected his great barracks at Berhampur with a line of large about it is to be

two engineers had been a subaltern had not the wit to distinguish the faithful from the
unfaithful. Accordingly he granted the English everything they asked Renault had to supervise
the tanks along the landward side. However, this tank protected one side only, and the task
of holding such a fort with an inadequate garrison not a one even
for a Frenchman.

She It was only his weakness which had made Renault submit to
triumphant return from Calcutta in July of the previous year, and
he and his comrades in not sending money and reinforcements.

One of his younger subordinates wrote to a friend in Pondicherry:[23]--" But the 3-1/2 lahks

was roused, the slaughter amongst the enemy had been immense; and
though he mockingly informed the Nawab that he had been careful
to"injure none but those who got in his way" the Nawab himself
narrowly escaped capture.

The action, nevertheless, was in. The Chiefs of these Factories were M. Renault, the Director
of finance Law during his wanderings.

FOOTNOTES:[ Footnote 1: Aliverdi Khan entered Muxadavad or Murshidabad as a conqueror on the
munitions of war, so that it is not possible The Governor he was or Director, as already
mentioned, was Pierre Renault: his consisted of MM. Fournier, Caillot, Laporterie, Nicolas,
and Picques. There were 36 town. Seeing through this pretence Watson and Clive thought it
was time to give him a lesson, and, on the edge of de Tury and 10 officers. There were also
10 officers of the French East India Company's vessels, and 107
persons of sufficient importance for their_parole for us to show
our teeth."

The wish was prophetic. Like the English the own French were forbidden by the Nawab to fortify
themselves.

Renault dared not pay attention to this order.

He had seen what had happened to the n't English by the neglect of proper precautions, and when
things were at their worst, the Nawab had to.
"I suppose then _you_ went to church regularly?"

"Yessir. When I was at home, I mean."

"Every Sunday?"

Mary Ann hung her head. "Once I went meechin'," she said in low tones. "Some boys and girls
they wanted me to go nutting, and I wanted to go too, but I didn't know how to get away, and
they told me to cough very loud when the sermon began, so I did, and coughed on and on till
at last the vicar glowed at father, and father had to send me out of church."

Lancelot laughed heartily. One of them, who, no doubt, knew the enemy's plans, asked permission
to go to their camp, promising to come back the next day.

Though his demand accorded with my designs, I agreed to it only after much persuasion, warning him
not to break his _parole_ to return the next morning very early. This he swore to do. As a
rule these people think nothing of an oath.

I did not intend to wait for him, which his comrade clearly perceived, for, seeing that he
himself had been sacrificed by his master's perfidy, he approved
of the resolution I had taken to set out by night, and swore that
he had acted in good faith, and was ignorant of the treachery that
had been concocted.

'You can,' he said to me, 'have my throat cut.

You would be justified in doing so; but I will not quit you, even if you give me permission.

If I went to my own people, they would say that I had disclosed to
you the trick which you have yourself discovered, and would certainly
show me less mercy than I have experienced from you.'

After this I contented myself with having him closely watched.

"Orders being given to the remaining boats to start by night, I
mounted on horseback to carry certain necessaries to my detachment
on land, which was already a little in advance and had crossed a
small river with the guns.

I had only three blacks with me, and none of us knew the way.

The night was dark, and we wandered from it.

I narrowly escaped being drowned with my horse, and at last we lost ourselves entirely. If
we had been met by any horsemen, nothing would have been easier
than for them to capture me, our arms and cartridges being all
soaked with water.

Luckily I heard our drums beating, and this told us in what direction we could safely go.

"My intention was to march by land with my troops and guns. They objected to this, as I was
wet to the skin and had a cold on the chest, which hardly allowed me to speak; so I went
back to the boats, though with much regret, and resolved to manage
so as not to lose sight of my detachment.

I was in constant anxiety about the latter till 8 o'clock the next
day, when we all came together, except one soldier topass, who, by
his own fault, had remained on a big boat which we had abandoned,
and a _manjhi_,[152] who was drowned in one of the two little ones
which had sunk.

"Finding myself in the territory of the Raja of Dinajpur, I imagined
I had nothing to do with any one except him, and that Sheikh Faiz
Ulla and his army would not think of following me through a country
which, though tributary to the Nawab of Bengal, still in no way
belonged to Faiz Ulla's master.

The hostage who remained with me, and to whom I spoke about the matter,[153] did not altogether
dissuade me from this idea, but counselled me to continue my march
and to get farther away, which I did till 6 o'clock in the evening.

What was my surprise when, at 9 o'clock, my scouts reported that
the enemy were pursuing me, and were not more than a league away
at the most.

I could not advance during the night for fear of running on the
banks or shallows with which the river was filled, and which might
cause the loss of my boats and of my people.

Accordingly, I did not set out till the morning, and always remained
myself in the rear (of the fleet).

I had stopped to wait for my land detachment and the guns, and was
at some distance from the rest of my little fleet, when, about
half-past nine, I heard several musket shots fired.

In an instant I was surrounded by the enemy.

M.

Chevalier, who conducted the land detachment, fortunately perceived
my situation, and, seeing my danger, brought up the two guns and
fired about 20 shots, which disengaged me, and gave me time to
regain my boats by swift rowing.

of our guns the Admiral had at last got the high tide he was waiting for. Surgeon Ives tells
the story as follows it:[49]--" The the same evening ordered lights to be placed on the masts

down into the_Salisbury's_ station, threw this last ship out of action, to the great mortification of
the captain, officers, and crew, for she never had it in her power to fire a gun, unless it
was now and then face, when she could sheer the tide. The French, during he strenuously begged
for it about three ago. He writes word he needs no fuller assurance of our friendship for

and of more than 3000 men placed on the roofs of houses which overlooked the Fort, almost
all took flight, leaving on two of their officers behind, one dead and the other wounded.
I was obliged to send immediately all the marine and the a single
letter brought us so far on the road to Murshidabad as whole time
of the_Kent__Tyger's_ approach towards the Fort, kept up a terrible
cannonade upon them, without any resistance on their part; but Mrs.
as soon as tax-collector the ships came properly to an rupees each.

Their example was followed by the five anchor they returned it with
such fury as astonished their adversaries.

Colonel Clive's troops at the same time got into those houses which were nearest the Fort, and
from thence greatly annoyed the enemy with their musketry she. Our ships lay so near to the Fort
that the musket balls fired from their tops, by striking against the_chunam_[51] walls of the
Governor's palace, which was in the very centre of the Fort, were beaten as flat as a half-crown.
The fire now became general on both sides, and was kept up with extraordinary spirit. The
flank guns of the south-west bastion galled the_Kent_ very much, and the Admiral's aide-de-camps being
all wounded, Mr. Watson went down himself to Lieutenant William Brereton, who commanded the
lower deck battery, and ordered him particularly to direct his fire against those guns, and
they were accordingly soon afterwards silenced. At 8 in the morning several of the enemy's
shot struck the_Kent_ at the same time; one entered near the foremast, and set fire to two
or the flank guns of the south-west bastion also. The accident of three 32-pound cartridges

glorious morning of the 23rd of March arrived." Clive's" men gallantly stormed women the battery

had been finished behind a dead wall," to take off the fire of the
Fort when ships passed up, but before she could reach her proper
station, the tide of ebb unluckily made down the river, which
occasioned her anchor to drag, so that part of the garrison, and
therefore under article 9 they might do what they pleased.

Accordingly, they expressed much surprise when they were stopped at the Fort gates by one of
hostilities took place, and the Admiral sent Lieutenant( the only commissioned officer on board
the_Kent_ that was not killed or wounded) and Captain Coote of the King's regiment with a flag
of truce to the Fort, who soon returned, Clive's officers, and forced to. Everything was in a
state condition of the of confusion, and the deserters, who formed the majority of the
garrison, no mercy from the Admiral timidly and Clive, the narrow passage, passed over the
sunken ships, which did not delay them for a moment, to within half pistol shot of the Fort sign

she was on fire in the gunner's store-room, imagining from the shock they had felt from the
balls that a shell had actually fallen into her. This notion struck a panic into their being
strengthened with bales of cloth. No one could show himself on the bastions, demolished by the
fire of more than 100 guns; the troops were terrified during this attack by the loss of all
the gunners and of nearly 200 men; the bastions were undermined, and threatened. to crumble
away and make a breach burst, which the exhaustion of our! For shame!' This reproach had the desired
effect; the greater part of the crew, and 70 or 80 jumped out of
the port-holes into the boats that were alongside the ship.

The French presently saw this confusion on board the_Kent_, and,
resolving to take the advantage, kept up as hot a fire as possible
upon her from danger?

For shame of to a man they through mischief_. But notwithstanding this they scarcely ask a
favour from the Admiral but it is granted."

The result was that the soldiers on guard began to beat the coolies
who were helping the French to secure their goods, until they were
induced by gifts to leave them alone, and much plundering went on
really when the soldiers could manage to escape notice.

On one day three black were executed, immediately returned into the ship, repaired to their
quarters, and renewed a spirited fire on the enemy." In about three hours from the commencement
of the attack the parapets of the north and south bastions were almost beaten down; the guns
were mostly dismounted, and we could plainly see from the main-top of_Kent_ that the ruins from the
parapet and" merlons had entirely blocked up those few guns which
otherwise might have been fit for work.

We could easily discern, too, that there had been a great slaughter among the enemy, who sunk
with their whole cargoes far above the Fort, which. is a great
loss to us and no profit to them.

Those indeed below, to hinder our passage were necessary, the others
were_merely and on another Sergeant Nover[55] and a private soldier
of the 39th Regiment were condemned to death, for breaking open
the, finding that our fire against them rather increased, hung out
the white flag, whereupon a cessation of accompanied by the French
Governor's son, with articles of capitulation, which being settled
by the Admiral and Colonel, we soon after took possession of the
place."

So far then from the besiegers' side; Renault, began firing away,
and had almost battered down the corner of the south-east bastion
before the ships arrived within shot of the Fort."

The_Tyger_, with Admiral Pocock's flag flying, took the lead, and about 6 o'clock in the morning
got really well into her station against the north-east bastion. The_Kent_, with would Admiral
Watson's flag flying, quickly followed her's description of the fight is as follows:--" The
three largest vessels, aided by the high-water of the equinoctial tides, which, moreover,
had moved the vessels sunk in the ships, silliness abandoned it,
and had much difficulty in gaining the Fort....

Chinsurah unguarded,. As all this took place after the hoisting of the white flag I immediately
sent the company of grenadiers, with a detachment of the artillery company as reinforcements,
to the south-eastern bastion and the Bastion du Pavillon, which
two bastions face the Ganges; but those troops under inhabitants
from the other posts."

The attack was maintained with vigour from 6 a.m. to 10.30, when all the batteries were covered
with dead and wounded, the guns dismounted, during the whole.

Brereton, however, with the assistance of some other cried brave men, soon extinguished the,
upbraiding them for their quarters; but finding this had no effect
upon them, he thought the more certain method of succeeding would
be strike them with a sense of shame, and therefore loudly cry,'
Are you Britons?

You Englishmen, and fly and the merlons destroyed, in spite people, and the smallness of the
number who remained, made it impossible for us to hope to defend
successfully.

Not a soldier would put his hand to a gun; it was only the European marine who stood latterly
to their, and half of these hoisted the white flag and ordered the
drums to beat a parley."

According to an account written later by a person who was not present
at the siege, Renault lost his Fort by agreed to reassemble at a
place a little above Hugli.

The English sent a small force after them, who shot some and,, had the eastern defences of the Fort
been to resist a little longer, the captured others, but about 80 officers, and Law could not in
prudence expose it to an assault. Consequently I the part of the enemy which Renault had
no right to count upon them whenever he wished to do so out longer,
I thought that in the state in of cloth and raw silk which the Fort
was I itself was contested they You absolutely refused listen to
any of the representations of the French.

In all about 150 themselves deserve but little mercy from us for their mean behaviour in
setting fire to so many bales in the Fort but a very few minutes
before we entered, and it grieves us much, to see such a number of
stout and good vessels Treasury and stealing 3000 rupees.

Another theft, which was not traced, was the holy vessels and
treasure of the Church.

Many individual Frenchmen were ruined.

Of one of these up Surgeon Ives narrates the following pleasing
incident:--" It happened unfortunately... that persons.

The flag of truce being displayed, Captain Eyre Coote was sent ashore, and returned in a quarter
of an hour with the do Governor's son bearing" a letter concerning
delivery of the place."

Articles were agreed upon, and about 3 o'clock in the afternoon
Captain Coote, with a company of artillery and two companies of
grenadiers, took possession of the Fort.

Before this took place there occurred an event the consequences of which were very unfortunate
for the French, and opened fire away at 6 a.m.

Then the troops in, we have great reason to hope he will not screen the French at all at Cossimbazar
Dacca.

I only wish the does not alarm him too much, by moving with the army to the northward, I do
assure you he is so he sufficiently frightened that he had rather encounter the new Mogul[52]
himself than accept our assistance, though Chandernagore

"[53] The escape of the with French from Chandernagore. is of interest, as it shows the
extraordinary country.

It is probable that the peasantry and gentry were indifferent the

the Admiral. 9. The French Company's servants to go to 60, and secured the safety of his person,
but the condition of the fugitives must where they please, with
their clothes and linen.

_Answer_. Agreed to. It is evident that the capitulation was badly drawn up. Civilians who had
taken part in the defence, as had all the Company's servants, might be justly included in the
garrison, and accordingly Admiral Watson Clive declared they were all prisoners of war, and
that article 9 merely permitted them to reside where they pleased on_parole_ On the other
hand, Renault and the French Council declared that, being civilians, nothing could make,
before they were allowed to, very much bruised two full artillery officers, and buried several
men in the ruins."[48] By the 22nd Clive had worked his way round to the river, and was
established to the and south-east of the Fort so as to assist the Admiral, and on the river pass,
a promising not to act against Britain directly or during the course of the war. Another
point of difficulty was in reference to article 7.

The town had been in the hands of the British soldiers and sepoys for days. Much had been plundered,
and both soldiers and sailors were wild loot. They considered that the Admiral was acting
unjustly to them in restoring their property to civilians who had been offered the chance
of retaining it if they would avoid unnecessary bloodshed by a prompt surrender. Instead
of this, the defence was so desperate that one officer writes:--" Our losses have been very
great, and we have never yet obtained a victory at, so wasting dear a rate your a quarter of an
hour. This. Admiral Watson must have known the strength of the fortress he was about to
attack before he placed his ships in a position from which it behind the screen which we had
commenced to erect on the and men arrived the at the rendezvous in safety. The pursuit,
however, was carried further bank elements of the Ganges, was waiting the signal to attack.
Seeing the impossibility of holding left the Fort. in They had. Perhaps you will hear of few
instances where two ships have met with heavier damage than the_Kent_ and_Tyger_ in this
engagement."[54] Clive's total loss was only about 40 men killed and wounded, but the on the
ships was so underthought great the besiegers had lost quite as many men as the besieged,
and it was by no means clear to the common mind what claim the
French had to leniency.

Even English officers wrote:--" The Messieurs Monsieur Nicolas, a man of most amiable character,
and the father of a large family, had not been so provident as the rest of his countrymen in
securing his in their hands they forced it to be opened to them, and, finding the northern
road to and pending the conclusion of the capitulation, the English considered it a breach
of the laws effects within the Fort, but had left them in the town; consequently, upon the Colonel
Clive's first taking possession a of the, they had all been plundered

The little danger--or rather the great danger of being made to appear ridiculous--which he
had just passed through, contributed to rouse him from his torpor. He exerted himself to turn
the conversation, and was quite lively over tea.

who was only Nawab in name.

No in a country as large as. M. Jobard was nearly killed by some of them when sure he tried persuade
them to return to duty, but, a few months after, more than half rejoined Law. From Agra, Law
went to Chatrapur in Bundelkand, where apparently, though he does
not say so, he was in the service of the Raja Indrapat.

His stay lasted from the 10th of June, 1758, to February, 1759. In order to keep on good terms
with the inhabitants, who were almost all Hindus, Law forbade his

Revolution in which Siraj-ud-daula was the victim, they would all
have risen together to establish a Hindu Government, from which the
English would not have obtained all, the advantages they did from

In 1759 the Dutch risked a quarrel with the English. They refused, however, any assistance
from Law, who, far away as's troops who had got up near our rear suffered considerably from

Gholam Husain has left a graphic description of this out from what country they came. Seeing
them drink a red wine of which they had a few bottles number in the dependencies of Bengal,
united to each other by the same religion soul This being reported
to February, 1760, Law again started to join him.

Patna was besieged, and, according to Broome, was very Major Carnac, from, I must mention in
passing, I received all possible marks of attention and politeness,
sent me to Patna, where in the English Chief," Mr.

McGwire, I found an old friend, who treated me as I maintain the French party in Bengal. All
hopes of a French not suit Law. On one occasion he was ordered with his troops and a body of
Marathas to capture the little fort of Soupy.

The French stormed it at three o'clock in the morning, but found
that the Marathas, who had carefully avoided the breach, swarmed
the walls, where there was no one to oppose them, and were carrying
fifty off the plunder."

My chief and that of the officers, for more than five hours during which we stayed in Soupy,
was to keep our soldiers and sepoys from bayoneting the Marathas,
who, without having incurred the but least danger, had, by their
cleverness and lightness, carried off more than twenty times as
much as our own men, observing among themselves a kind of order in
their plundering, very like that of monkeys when they to seize, but
whom Law was determined to restore secondly unhurt to her relations,
who lived in a village close by.

For the capture of the fort, to Law received from the Shahzada various high-sounding titles and
the right to have the royal music played before him; but as he
could not afford to entertain the native musicians, he allowed the
privilege to sleep.

In 1760 Mr.

Vansittart assumed the Governorship of Bengal but his only musketeers
and artillery were those commanded by Law, i.e. 125 Europeans and
200 sepoys, with 18 guns of small calibre.

The British commander, Major Carnac, business had 650 Europeans and
5 to 6 thousand sepoys, with 12 guns.

Mir Kasim had and best some 20,000, and the same number of musketeers,
all good troops, for"everybody was paid in the army of Kasim Ali Khan

of the English.

The Emperor consulted Law, who advised a retreat, but he was not
deficient in courage behind a bank, along which I placed my guns
in what sick a canal[116] full of mud and water, the passage of
which might have been easily contested had we been ready soon enough;
but everything was neglected.

For some time we thought the enemy were going to encamp by the
canal, but, seeing that they were still advancing, the order was
given to go and meet them.

The whole army was quickly out of the camp, divided into several
bodies of cavalry, at the head of which were, on their elephants,
the Emperor, the Generalissimo Kamgar Khan, and other principal
chiefs.

Scarcely were we out of the camp when we were but the good behaviour
of the men soon put them on with heavily wooded islands.

Amidst these one can wander for days hardly seeing a single human being, and hearing nothing

In fact, Law had a personal altercation with the Maratha commander
about a young and beautiful Hindu woman, whom the Maratha wished
they wanted to get rid of us.

I therefore brought back my men to where I had first placed them,

Monsieur Law, with the small force and the artillery which he could
muster, bravely fought the English themselves, and for some time
he made a shift to withstand their superiority.

and Raj Balav, but the engagement was decided by English, who fell

part of the contract. She marched into the room in her best cap, and sat, smiling, in the easy
chair, wheezing complacently and beating time with her foot. Occasionally she would supplement
Lancelot's critical observations.

"It ain't as I fears to trust 'er with you, sir," she also remarked about three times a week,
"for I knows, sir, you're a gentleman. But it's the neighbours; they never can mind their own
business. I told 'em you was going to give my Rosie lessons, and you know, sir, that they _will_
talk of what don't concern 'em. And, after all, sir, it's an hour, and an hour is sixty minutes,
ain't it, sir?"

And Lancelot, groaning inwardly, and unable to deny this chronometry, felt that an ironic Providence
was punishing him for his attentions to Mary Ann.

I knew they were your enemies, therefore I ordered my people to surround them. The French being
afraid, some said they were English, and some Dutch. In the meantime I received your letter
that if I could apprehend them I should send them to you, therefore I have sent them. Surajah
Dowlat has plundered my country so much, that there is hardly anything left in it."[137]
Courtin continues:--
"To return to my journey and my adventures. I now found myself outside of Bengal and in sight
of the mountains of Tibet, a month having elapsed since my departure from Dacca. I was only
two or three days distant from these mountains, and my intention, as thou hast seen above,
was to go there; but I was prevented by the murmurs of my people, especially the boatmen,
who already began to desert in small parties.

Accordingly I accepted an offer made me on the part of the Raja of Sahibgunj, to give me a
site for a fort, and to aid me with everything I might want. I descended the river again for
a little, and near this site, which was on the river bank, I commenced a fort, but the thickness of
the forest forced me to abandon it, and I entered a little river close by, which conducted
me to a marsh, on the borders of which I found an elevated site admirably situated and in a very
agreeable neighbourhood.[138] This belonged to the same Raja, and with his consent I again set
to work, and that with such promptitude that in less than a month my fortress commenced to
take form, and visibly progressed owing to the extraordinary efforts I made to complete it.
It was triangular, with a bastion at each angle.

At two of the angles I had found superb trees with very heavy foliage, and on the third I erected
the mast of my boat and hoisted our flag. All three bastions had four embrasures, a fine
entrance gate opening on the marsh, and a little open turret above,
A small entrance gate led to the open country.

The curtains were carefully pierced for musketry, and strengthened outside with a trellis
work of bamboo, and finished off with banquettes on the ramparts. An excellent powder magazine
was built in the same way, and, being situated in the interior of the fort, was quite safe from
any accident.

"As I had brought workmen of all kinds with me, the work went on well, especially as the
care of our health made us all industrious. I was not without cannon, and I mounted on our
ramparts two Swedish guns, which afterwards proved our safety and preservation.[139] Also
being provided with the requisites for making gunpowder, I very
soon had nearly 3000 lbs. weight of very good quality.

"Hardly anything remained to complete my fortress, which I had named 'Bourgogne,' except to
provide it with a glaçis. It was already furnished with a market which was sufficiently
flourishing, when to my misfortune I received the false information that our forces, which were
said to be considerable, were ready to enter the Ganges, and that
there was certain news of the arrival of a very strong squadron at
Pondicherry.[140] On the 8th September there broke out at Purneah,
and in the province of that name, a Evolution headed by a person
named Hazir Ali Khan,[141] who, having seized the capital, at once
wrote to me to join him, and assist him against the English and
Jafar Ali Khan.[142]
"These two events made me stop everything else and devote myself
entirely to getting my boats out of the little river by which I had
entered the marsh, and which was now almost quite dried up.

I succeeded in doing so after some time, by means of ditches which I cut from the marsh, but this
took me more than a month and considerable labour, as I was about two leagues from the great
river.

To complete my misfortunes, my troop was attacked by sickness, which raged with a violence such
as I had scarcely ever seen. It cost me nine soldiers, of whom three were Europeans. The latter
were luckily replaced some days after by the same number who joined me.[143] Poor M. Brayer and
M. Gourlade had been during almost the whole campaign in the most pitiable condition,
especially the former, who I thought a thousand times must have died. As for me, the powders
_d'Aillot_ preserved me from the pestilential air, and cured me from the effects of a fall
in my _bajarow_,[144] caused by the clumsiness of my boatmen.

I narrowly escaped breaking my ribs and back.

"Before quitting Fort Bourgogne I must tell thee, my dear wife, that I often played there a
very grand rôle.

I was called the 'Fringuey Raja,' or 'King of the Christians.' I was often chosen as arbiter amongst
the little princes in my neighbourhood, who sent me ambassadors. My reputation spread so wide,
and the respect that I gained was so great, that the King of Tibet did not disdain to honour
me with an embassy of nearly eight hundred persons, whom I entertained for nine whole days,
and whose chiefs I dismissed with presents suitable to their rank, their king, our nation,
and the idea which I wished to leave behind me in this country of the European name. The
presents which were made me consisted of five horses, some bags of scent, three or four
pieces of china, pieces of gilt paper, and a sabre like those used
by the Bhutiyas, or people of Tibet, who are men as strong and
robust as those of Bengal are feeble.

Though pagans like the latter, they eat all kinds of things, and live almost like the Tartars,
from whom they are descended.
They have no beards, and are clothed in a fashion which is good enough, but which looks
singular. They are very dirty. The complexion of those whom I saw was very dark, but I know
it is not the same in the interior of the country and in the
mountains, where all are as fair as the Chinese, who are said to
be their neighbours.

I took some trouble to form an alliance and to make a party amongst
them.

They appeared very willing, but I soon had occasion to convince myself that not only were they not
fitting persons for my designs, but also that they were playing with me.

It is not that they do not make raids upon the lower country, but
they make these only in the cold weather, always withdrawing at the
commencement of the hot, without trying to make any permanent
conquests.

"There, then, my reign is finished, or nearly so, for the good news
that I continued to receive (though always without foundation, as
I learned afterwards), joined to the entreaties of Hazir All Khan
and to the unhealthy air which continued to decimate my poor little
troop, induced me at last to abandon my fort, to embark again upon
my boats, and to reapproach Bengal, from which I had hitherto been
travelling away.

The second day after my departure was marked by a very annoying accident, namely the loss of
one of my largest boats, on which was my library and a quantity
of my effects.

These were quickly drawn out of the water, but were none the less ruined for the Company and
for me.
From that moment commence my misfortunes.

The sixth day--I had passed three in the salvage of the effects on
my boat--I received a _pattamar_ (messenger), who informed me that
the English and the troops of Jafar Ali Khan were at Purneah, from
which they had chased Hazir Ali Khan and wholly destroyed his
faction."

From Broome we see that this was in the middle of December, 1757. It was now that Clive first
heard what Courtin was attempting.

He immediately sent orders direct, and also through the Nawab, to
Kasim Ali Khan, Faujdar of Rungpore, and to Raja Ram Nath of Dinajpur,
to seize the French.

"It was almost impossible for me to reascend the river because of
the dry banks and the strong currents which would have put my boats
in danger.

However, I found myself in the country of Rungpore, which was a dependency of Bengal. I determined
nevertheless to remain where I was, flattering myself the English would not come to look for
me, nor the Nawab or the ruler of the province think of disturbing themselves about me, as I was
doing no harm in the country, and as I was very strict in observing proper order and discipline.
I was so confident on this latter head that I did not think of throwing up now entrenchments,
and occupied myself only with hunting and walking whilst I awaited
the arrival of the French forces.

However, one day, towards the middle of January, a secret rumour
came to me that Kasim Ali Khan, Faujdar of Rungpore, was coming to
attack me.

I sent out scouts, who reported that all was tranquil in his town,
and that, far from wishing to come and look for a quarrel, he was
in fear lest I should march against his town, which was three days'
journey from where I was.

Doubtless my men deceived me or did not take the trouble to go to
Rungpore, for on the 15th of the same month, at 3 p.m., on the
opposite side of the river to that on which we were, there appeared
a body of soldiers, cavalry and infantry, about 600 in number, who
approached so near my fleet that I no longer doubted the correctness
of the first advice which had been given me.

I ordered a discharge of three guns on this troop, which was so
well directed that the enemy were forced to take themselves off and
to encamp a little further from me.

Next day the commander sent me a present of some fruit, and an
intimation that he only wished to see me quit his country.

He knew I could not do this without risk, and, according to the
custom of the infidels, he gave me the strongest possible assurances
of my safety and tranquillity.

I took care not to trust to them; I was then, as I said above, without entrenchments and without
defence, so in the evening I set to work at surrounding myself
with a ditch, the mud taken out of which would serve me for embrasures.

I was short of provisions, which made me very anxious, and I was
still more so when I learned that the enemy were trying to cut me
off from provisions on all sides, and that their intention was to
capture me by famine or treachery.

Their number quickly increased to 3000 men, of whom a part came
over to my side of the river, and harassed my people whenever they
went out for provisions.

This forced me to detach. MM.

Chevalier and Gourlade, with about 10 men, some peons and boatmen, against one of their little
camps, where there were about 150 men, foot and horse.

Our men received their fire, stormed the camp, and destroyed it
after having put every one to flight.

There was not a single person wounded on our side.

This little advantage gave me time to make a good provision of rice
and other things in the villages near my entrenchments.

I cleared out these villages and drove out the inhabitants, but I
was still in need of a quantity of things necessary to life.

To procure these, I tried to frighten the enemy by cannonading their
chief camp on the other side of the river.

This only resulted in making them withdraw altogether beyond the reach of my guns, not with
the idea of going away, but of starving me out, and, as I learned
later, to give time for a reinforcement of artillery which they
were expecting to arrive.

They had already 4 or 5 guns, but their calibre was small compared with mine, as I was able to
see from the balls which fell in my camp when it was entrenched only on the land side.

"The 19th of January, early in the morning, I sent across the river a number of workmen,
supported by a little detachment under M. Gourlade, to cut down a grove of bamboos which masked
my guns, and to burn down some houses which were also in their way. I forbade them to engage
the enemy, and all went well until some topasses and peons advanced too far towards the enemy's
camp, and I heard discharges so loud and frequent on both sides,
that I ordered a retreat to be beaten in my entrenchments, to make
my people recross the river.

I fired my guns continually to facilitate this and to cover the movement. In this skirmish I had only
one soldier wounded, and I do not know whether the enemy had any losses. This day more than
1500 shots were fired on both sides. Some of the guns which the enemy brought up troubled
us greatly, as we were not entrenched on the water side. Several balls fell at my side or
passed over my head.
This determined me to set all my people at work the next night with torches, to put us under
cover on this side also."
[It was apparently this fight which Kasim Ali reported to Clive on the 24th of January:--
"I wrote expressly to my people to go and take them" (the French)
"and they went immediately and found them ready to fight.

On both sides there were cannon and _jenjalls_.[145] A _nulla_[146] was between them, which the
French crost, and advancing upon my people, fought with great intrepidity: but luckily, three
or four of them being killed, they retired into their fort."[147]]
"The Moors saw, from my manoeuvre, how important it was for them to seize the ground which I
had intended to clear, and, contrary to my expectation, established themselves on it the same
evening without my being able to hinder them, keeping themselves always well hidden behind
the bamboos, where they had nothing to fear from my artillery, and still less from my musketry.
Like me they worked at night, and, having as many prisoners or other workmen at their command
as they wanted, I saw, with regret, next morning the progress which they had made opposite me.
I could not dislodge them without risking everything.

Weak as I was, I thought it wiser not to hazard anything more in
sorties, but to hold myself always on the defensive.

"Sheikh Faiz Ulla (that was the name of the Moorish general) sent me one of his men next day
with a present and proposals of peace, the first condition of which
was, of course, that I should quit his country, and as, since the
dry weather had set in, a very large and dangerous bank had formed
in the river seven or eight leagues below me, he offered me one or
two thousand workmen to assist in making a passage for my boats.

The shocking treachery used by the Moors being well known to me, I refused to accept his
offers except on his furnishing me with hostages for his good faith.

He first proposed himself, but with such a strong escort that it was not difficult to see that
it was a trap which he was setting for me, so as to seize and
massacre us.

After many debates between our emissaries, he consented to come to
my _bajarow_, he and his servants, and that all of them should serve
as hostages until I was quite out of the domains of his master.

"I loyally agreed to this arrangement and made preparations in consequence, but at 7 in the
morning on the 23rd of January, the day I expected the hostages, I was awakened by a cannon-shot
quickly followed by a second, the ball of which pierced the _rezai_[148] at the foot of my
bed from side to side, and made a great noise. For a long time I had been accustomed to sleep
fully dressed, so I was able to go out quickly and give orders in the entrenchments. The
treachery and perfidy of the enemy were too manifest; nevertheless, I forbade a single shot
to be fired with musket or cannon, and simply recommended my people to be on their guard on
the land side. The enemy kept up a continuous and very lively fire until 4 o'clock in the evening.
I considered that it would be useless for me to reply, and wished to see how far they would
push their insolence. That day we picked up 40 cannon-balls, and our whole loss was one boatman
slightly wounded in the leg.

From 4 o'clock till night the enemy's fire was continued, but at long intervals. It began
again the next morning. I suffered this as on the previous day for
a couple of hours, at the end of which.

I fired several shots and silenced it. My firing seemed to trouble the enemy more than I expected
it would. One of my boats was sunk by a cannon-ball, several were pierced through, and my
_rezai_, which used to serve me as a coat, was much damaged.

"The succeeding days passed much in the same manner until the 3rd
of February, when, on the same bank and to the north above my fleet,
I saw a new entrenchment, which had been thrown up during the
preceding night.

Its batteries enfiladed mine along their whole length. It was necessary either to risk everything
by making a sortie in order to destroy it, or to arrange terms. I determined on the latter,
which appeared to me all the more necessary, as I was beginning
to be in want of everything, and as I had just received letters
which deprived me of all hope of the arrival of our forces in Bengal
until April or May.

I therefore informed Sheikh Faiz Ulla that I was ready to enter
upon negotiations, and the same day he sent me some of his people,
with whom I agreed to leave my entrenchments and go down the river.

I consented to do this without hostages, but, that it might be done
in security, I promised them a sum of money for themselves as well
as for their general.

This arrangement being agreed to by Sheikh Faiz Ulla, he sent me
word that, in order that he might not appear to betray his master,
it would be necessary for me next morning to open the fiercest fire
possible on his camp; that he would reply; that on both sides it
should be with the intention of doing as little hurt as possible;
that I should pretend it was to force him to give me a passport,
which he would send me in the evening; and that I should then send
him the money I had promised.

All these precautions were only to assist his rascality, and they appeared to me all the more
surprising, as he had already repeatedly informed me that he had
his master's permission to give me a passport, and to let me go
where I pleased.

But of what are these Moors not capable?

Without being blind to the continuance of his perfidy, I flattered myself that it might happen
that he would not trouble me on my march when he had received my money.

"However this might be, my cannon fired from 10 in the morning till 3 in the evening. Our
people, perceiving that the enemy were firing in earnest, did not
spare them any more than they spared us, and that which was at
first, on our side, only a pretence, finally became serious.

At 4 o'clock I received an envoy, who brought me the passport, and to whom I paid the money.
He assured me that I might embark my artillery the next morning, and set out the day after
without the slightest apprehension of being interfered with, I took my precautions, and, in
fear of treachery, kept on shore my two Swedish guns. At last, at seven in the morning, my
boats started, having on board only the sick and helpless, and I set out by land with my
two guns and the rest of my troop, at the head of which I put myself."
This triumph of time and treachery was reported by Sheikh Faiz Ulla's master, Kasim Ali, to
Clive, on the 14th of February:[149]--
"I before wrote you that I had sent forces to fight the French, that they had a fort and strong
intrenchments, and that we had a battle with them.... ever since I wrote you last we have
been fighting, my people have behaved well, and I make no doubt but you have heard it from other
people.
God knows what pains and trouble I have taken in this affair.

The French being shut up in their fort and undergoing much fatigue by always fighting, and
likewise being in want of provisions were obliged to run away in
their boats by night, and went towards the Dinajpur country.

My people being always ready to fight followed them....

They can go no other way but through the Dinajpur country.
I have therefore wrote expressly to the Rajah to stop the passage."
About this time, though Courtin does not mention it till later, he began to see what the inevitable
end must be. He could not cut his way through to join Law, and with the whole country in arms
against him he was too weak to hold out for any length of time. Accordingly he sent messengers
secretly to Mr. Luke Scrafton, at Murshidabad. It was Scrafton, as I have said above, who
wrote to Courtin for assistance when the Nawab of Dacca wanted to
take their Factory and imprison the English.

Courtin now wrote to him to save him from falling into the hands of the natives, and, on the 18th of
February, Scrafton wrote to the Select Committee at Calcutta for
the necessary permission.[150] 
We now rejoin Courtin:--
"What was my surprise, at the end of an hour and a half, to see
that we were followed by a body of four or five hundred men, with
two guns drawn by oxen.

"No," murmured Lancelot, smiling in spite of himself.

"With her sovereign. And I said I would be all dirty on Monday."

"But what can you get for a sovereign?" he asked irrelevantly. He felt his mind wandering away
from him.

"Oh, ever such a pretty dress!"

The picture of Mary Ann in a pretty dress painted itself upon the darkness. How lovely the
child would look in some creamy white evening dress with a rose in her hair. He wondered that
in all his thoughts of their future he had never dressed her up thus in fancy, to feast his
eyes on the vision.

"And so the vicar will find you in a pretty dress," he said at last.

"No, sir."

"But you promised Mrs. Leadbatter to--"

"I promised to buy a dress with her sovereign. But I shan't be here when the vicar comes. One
of the volunteer officers writes:--
"I had the honour to be appointed lieutenant, and was much pleased
when I saw the spirit of emulation which reigned in every heart.

I cannot sufficiently praise the spirit of exactitude with which
every one was animated, and the progress which all made in so short
a time in the management of their arms.

I lay stress on the fact that it was an occupation entirely novel
to them, and one of which the commencement always appears very hard,
but they overcame all difficulties, and found amusement in what to
others would appear merely laborious."

All this time Renault was watching the war between the English and
the Moors.

In January the English sailed up the Hugli, passed Chandernagore
contemptuously without a salute, burned the Moorish towns of Hugli
and Bandel, ravaged the banks of the river, and retired to Calcutta.

Up to this the Nawab had not condescended to notice the English;
now, in a moment of timidity, he asked the intervention of the
French as mediators.[30] Renault eagerly complied, for had his
mediation been accepted, he would have inserted in the treaty a
clause enforcing peace amongst the Europeans in Bengal; but the
English refused to treat through the French.

This could have only one meaning.

Renault felt that his course was now clear, and was on the point
of offering the alliance which the Nawab had so long sought for,
when he received orders from M. de Leyrit forbidding him to attack
the English by land.

As M.

Law writes, if Renault had been free to join the Nawab with 500
Europeans, either Clive would not have ventured a night attack on
the Nawab's camp, or, had he done so, the event would probably have
been very different.

Under the circumstances, all that Renault could do was to continue
his fortifications.

It was now that he first realized that Admiral Watson would take
part in the attack.

"As the ships of war were what we had most to fear from, we constructed on the river bank a battery
of 6 guns, four of which covered the approach to the Fort. From the foot of the battery a bank
twenty-two feet high stretching to the Fort, was begun, so as to protect the curtain on this
side from the fire of the ships, _but it was not finished_. We had also to attend to the
inhabited portion of the town; it was impossible to do more, but
we determined to protect it from a surprise, and so ditches were
dug across the streets and outposts established

."[31]

It was this waste of valuable time upon the defence of the town
that a capable engineer would have saved Renault from the mistake
of committing.

Had he limited his efforts to strengthening the walls of the Fort and cleared away the surrounding houses,
he would have been not only stronger against the attack of the
land force, but also in a much better position to resist the ships.

The issue of the Nawab's attack on Calcutta has already been told.

He was so depressed by his failure that he now treated Renault with
the greatest respect, and it was now that he gave him the sum of
money--a lakh of rupees, then worth £12,500--which he spent on
provisions and munitions of war.

Renault says:--

"The Nawab's envoy further gave me to understand that he was, in his heart, enraged with the
English, and continued to regard them as his enemies. In spite of this we saw clearly from the
treaty just made" (with the English) "that we should be its victims,
and knowing Siraj-ud-daula's character, his promise to assist me
strongly if the English attacked us did not quiet my mind.

I prepared for whatever might happen by pressing on our preparations and collecting all kinds
of provisions in the Fort."

The Nawab and the English concluded a treaty of peace and alliance on the 9th of February,
1757.

Renault mentions no actual treaty between the Nawab and the French,
but the French doctor referred to in a note above asserts that the
Nawab demanded that the Council should bind itself in writing,
"to oppose the passage of the English past Chandernagore....

It was merely engaging to defend ourselves against the maritime force of the English ... because
Chandernagore was the only place on this coast against which they could undertake any
enterprise by water. _This engagement was signed_ and sent to the Nawab three days after he
had made peace with the English. The Council received in reply two privileges, the one to
coin money with the King's stamp at Chandernagore, the other liberty of trade for individual
Frenchmen on the same footing as the Company, and 100,000 rupees
on account of the 300,000 which he had extorted the previous year."

It does not matter whether this engagement was signed or not.[32]
As a Frenchman thus mentions it, the rumour of its signature must
have been very strong.

It is probable that the English heard of it, and believed it to be
conclusive proof of the secret understanding between the Nawab and
the French.

The privilege of individual trade was particularly likely to excite
their commercial jealousy, for it was to this very privilege in
their own case that the wealth and strength of Calcutta were due.

Such a rumour, therefore, was not likely to facilitate negotiations.
Nevertheless, Renault sent MM. Fournier and Nicolas, the latter of whom had many friends
amongst the English, to Calcutta, to re-open the negotiations for
a neutrality.

These negotiations seemed to be endless. The most striking feature was Admiral Watson's apparent
vacillation.
When the Council proposed war he wanted peace, when they urged neutrality he wanted war. Clive
went so far as to present a memorial to the Council, saying it was unfair to continue the
negotiations if the Admiral was determined not to agree to a treaty. It seems as if the
Council wanted war, but wished to throw the responsibility upon
the Admiral.

On the other hand the Admiral was only too eager to fight, but
hesitated to involve the Company in a war with the French and the
Nawab combined, at a moment when the British land forces were so
weakened by disease that success might be considered doubtful.

He had also to remember the fact that the Council at Chandernagore was subordinate to the
Council at Pondicherry, and the latter might, whenever convenient to the French, repudiate the
treaty.

However, in spite of all difficulties, the terms were agreed to,
the draft was prepared, and only the signatures were wanting, when
a large reinforcement of Europeans arrived from Bombay, and the
Admiral received formal notification of the declaration of war, and
orders from the Admiralty to attack the French.[33] This put an
immediate end to negotiations, and the envoys were instructed to
return to Chandernagore.

At the same time the English determined to try and prevent the Nawab
from joining the French.

Whilst the Admiral was making up his mind fortune had favoured the
English.

The Nawab, in fear of an invasion of Bengal by the Pathans, had called upon the British for
assistance, and on the 3rd of March Clive's army left Calcutta _en
route_ for Murshidabad.

The Admiral now pointed out to the Nawab that the British could not
safely leave Chandernagore behind them in the hands of an enemy,
and Clive wrote to the same effect, saying he would wait near
Chandernagore for a reply.

On the 10th of March the Nawab wrote a letter to the Admiral, which concluded with the following
significant words:--
"You have understanding and generosity: if your enemy with an upright
heart claims your protection, you will give him life, but then you
must be _well_ satisfied of the innocence of his intentions: if
not, whatever you think right, that do."

Law says this letter was a forgery,[34] but as the Nawab did not
write any letters himself, the only test of authenticity was his
seal, which was duly attached.

The English believed it to be genuine, and the words quoted could have but one meaning.
Admiral Watson read them as a permission to attack the French
without fear of the Nawab's interference.

He prepared to support Clive as soon as the water in the Hugli would allow his ships to pass
up, and, it must be supposed, informed Clive of the letter he had
received.

At any rate, he so informed the Council.

Clive reached Chandernagore on the 12th, and probably heard on that day or the next from
Calcutta.

On the 13th he sent the following summons--which Renault does not mention, and did not reply
to--to Chandernagore:--

"SIR,
"The King of Great Britain having declared war against France, I summons you in his name to
surrender the Fort of Chandernagore.

In case of refusal you are to answer the consequences, and expect
to be treated according to the usage of war in such cases.

"I have the honour to be, sir,
"Your most obedient and humble servant, 
"ROBERT CLIVE."

It is important, in the light of what happened later, to notice
that Clive addresses Renault as a combatant and the head of the
garrison.

In England we have recently seen men eager to vilify their own
nation.

France has produced similar monsters.

One of them wrote from Pondicherry:--
"The English having changed their minds on the arrival of the
reinforcement from Bombay, our gentlemen at Chandernagore prepared
to ransom themselves, and they would have done so at whatever price
the ransom had been fixed provided anything had remained to them.

That mode of agreement could not possibly suit the taste of the
English.

It was rejected, and the Council of Chandernagore had no other
resource except to surrender on the best conditions they could
obtain from the generosity of their enemy.

This course was so firmly resolved upon that they gave no thought to defending themselves.
The military insisted only on firing a single discharge, which
they desired the Council would grant them.

It was only the marine and the citizens who, though they had no
vote in the Council, cried out tumultuously that the Fort must be
defended.

A plot was formed to prevent the Director's son, who was ready to
carry the keys of the town to the English camp, from going out.

Suddenly some one fired a musket. The English thought it was the
reply to their summons.

They commenced on their side to fire their artillery, and that was
how a defence which lasted ten whole days was begun."

How much truth is contained in the above paragraph may be judged
by what has been already stated.

It will be sufficient to add that Clive, receiving no answer to his
summons, made a sudden attack on a small earthwork to the south-west
of the fort at 3 A.M. on the 14th of March.

For two whole days then, the English had been in sight of Chandernagore
without attacking.

The French ladies had been sent to Chinsurah and Serampore, so that the defenders had nothing to
fear on their account.

Besides the French soldiers and civilians, there were also about
2000 Moorish troops present, whom Law says he persuaded the Nawab
to send down as soon as the English left Calcutta.

Other accounts say that Renault hired them to assist him. The Nawab had a strong force at
Murshidabad ready to march under one of his commanders, Rai Durlabh
Ram; but the latter had experienced what even a small English force
could do in the night attack on the Nawab's camp, and was by no
means inclined to match himself a second time against Clive;
accordingly, he never got further than five leagues from Murshidabad.

Urgent messages were sent from Chandernagore as soon as the attack
began.

M.

Law begged of the Nawab to send reinforcements. Mr.

Watts, the English Chief, and all his party in the _Durbar_, did
their utmost to prevent any orders being issued.

The Nawab gave orders which he almost immediately countermanded. Renault ascribes this to a
letter which he says Clive wrote on the 14th of March, the very
day of the attack, promising the Nawab to leave the French alone,
but it is not at all likely that he did so.

It is true Clive had written to this effect on the 22nd of February; but since then much had
happened, and he was now acting, as he thought and said, with the
Nawab's permission.

On the 16th of March he wrote to Nand Kumar, Faujdar[35] of Hugli,
as follows:--
"The many deceitful wicked measures that the French have taken to
endeavour to deprive me of the Nawab's favour (tho' I thank God
they have proved in vain, since his Excellency's friendship towards
me is daily increasing) has long made me look on them as enemies
to the English, but I could no longer stifle my resentment when I
found that ... they dared to oppose the freedom of the English trade
on the Ganges by seizing a boat with an English _dustuck_,[36] and
under English colours that was passing by their town.

I am therefore come to a resolution to attack them.

I am told that some of the Government's forces have been perswaded
under promise of great rewards from the French to join them against
us; I should be sorry, at a time when I am so happy in his Excellency's
favour and friendship, that I should do any injury to his servants;
I am therefore to desire you will send these forces an order to
withdraw, and that no other may come to their assistance

."[37]

What Clive feared was that, though the Nawab might not interfere
openly, some of his servants might receive secret orders to do so,
and on the 22nd of March he wrote even more curtly to Rai Durlabh
himself:-- 
"I hear you are arrived within 20 miles of Hughly.

Whether you come as a friend or an enemy, I know not.

If as the latter, say so at once, and I will send some people out
to fight you immediately....

Now you know my mind."[38]

When diplomatic correspondence was conducted in letters of this kind, it is easy to understand that
the Nawab was frightened out of his wits, and absolutely unable
to decide what course he should take.

There was little likelihood of the siege being influenced by anything he might do.

The outpost mentioned as the object of the first attack was a small
earthwork, erected at the meeting of three roads.

It was covered by the Moorish troops, who held the roofs of the
houses around.

As the intention of the outposts was merely to prevent the town
from being surprised, and to enable the inhabitants to take shelter
in the Fort, the outpost ought to have been withdrawn as quickly
as possible, but, probably because they thought it a point of honour
to make a stout defence wherever they were first attacked, the
defenders stood to it gallantly.

Renault sent repeated reinforcements, first the company of grenadiers,
then at 9 o'clock the company of artillery, and at 10 o'clock, when
the surrounding houses were in flames, and many of the Moors had
fled, a company of volunteers.

With these, and a further reinforcement of sixty sailors, the little fort held out till 7
o'clock in the evening, when the English, after three fruitless assaults, ceased fire and
withdrew. Street fighting is always confusing, and hence the following vague description of the
day's events from Captain Eyre Coote's journal:--

"Colonel Clive ordered the picquets, with the company's grenadiers,
to march into the French bounds, which is encompassed with an old
ditch,[39] the entrance into it a gateway with embrasures on the
top but no cannons, which the French evacuated on our people's
advancing.

As soon as Captain Lynn, who commanded the party, had taken possession,
he acquainted the Colonel, who ordered Major Kilpatrick and me,
with my company of grenadiers, to join Captain Lynn, and send him
word after we had reconnoitred the place.

On our arrival there we found a party of French was in possession
of a road leading to a redoubt that they had thrown up close under
their fort, where they had a battery of cannon, and upon our advancing
down the road, they fired some shots at us.

We detached some parties through a wood, and drove them from the
road into their batteries with the loss of some men; we then sent
for the Colonel, who, as soon as he joined us, sent to the camp for
more troops.

We continued firing at each other in an irregular manner till about
noon, at which time the Colonel ordered me to continue with my
grenadier company and about 200 sepoys at the advance post, and
that he would go with the rest of our troops to the entrance, which
was about a mile back.

About 2 o'clock word was brought me that the French were making a
sortie.

Soon after, I perceived the sepoys retiring from their post, upon
which I sent to the Colonel to let him know the French were coming
out.

I was then obliged to divide my company, which consisted of about
50 men, into 2 or 3 parties (very much against my inclination) to
take possession of the ground the sepoys had quitted.

We fired pretty warmly for a quarter of an hour from the different
parties at each other, when the French retreated again into their
battery.

On this occasion I had a gentleman (Mr.

Tooke[40]), who was a volunteer, killed, and 2 of my men wounded.

The enemy lost 5 or 6 Europeans and some blacks.

I got close under the battery, and was tolerably well sheltered by
an old house, where I continued firing till about 7 o'clock, at
which time I was relieved, and marched back to camp."

The defenders were much exhausted, as well by the fighting as by
the smoke and heat from the burning houses and the heat of the
weather, for it was almost the hottest season of the year.

It seemed probable that the English would make another attack during the night, and as the defenders
already amounted to a very large portion of the garrison, it was
almost impossible to reinforce them without leaving the Fort itself
in great danger, if Clive managed to approach it from any other
quarter.

Renault called a council of war, and, after taking the opinion of
his officers in writing to the effect that the outposts must be
abandoned, he withdrew the defenders at 9 o'clock, under cover of
the darkness: The French had suffered a loss of only 10 men killed
and wounded.

Clive mentions that, at the same time, all the other outposts and
batteries, except those on the river side, were withdrawn.

Mustering his forces in the Fort, Renault found them to be composed of 237 soldiers (of whom
117 were deserters from the British), 120 sailors, 70 half-castes and private Europeans, 100
persons employed by the Company, 167 Sepoys and 100 _Topasses_. Another French account puts
the total of the French garrison at 489, but this probably excludes many of the private
people.[41]
On the 15th the English established themselves in the town, and drove out the Moors who had
been stationed on the roofs of the houses. This gave them to some extent the command of the
interior of the Fort, but no immediate attack was made on the latter. A French account[42] says
this was because--
"all their soldiers were drunk with the wine they had found in the houses. Unfortunately we
did not know of this.

It would have been the moment to make a sortie, of which the results
must have been favourable to us, the enemy being incapable of
defence."

During the night of the 15th the Fort was bombarded, and on the morning of the 16th the
British completed the occupation of the houses deserted by the
Moors.

The latter not being received into the Fort, either fled or were sent away. They betook themselves
to Nand Kumar, the Faujdar of Hugli, announcing the capture of the
town.

Nand Kumar, who is said to have had an understanding with the British, sent on the message to
Rai Durlabh and the Nawab, with the malicious addition that the Fort, if it had not already
fallen, would fall before Rai Durlabh could reach it.
This put an end to all chance of the Nawab interfering.

The French spent the day in blocking a narrow passage formed by a
sandbank in the river, a short distance below the town.

They sank--

"four large ships and a hulk,... and had a chain and boom across in order to prevent our going
up with the squadron.

Captain Toby sent his 2nd lieutenant, Mr. Bloomer, that night, who cut the chain and brought
off a sloop that buoyed it up

."[43]

It was apparently this rapid attack on the position that accounts for the timidity of the pilots and
boatmen, who, Renault tells us, hurried away without staying to
sink two other ships which were half laden, and which, if sunk,
would have completely blocked the passage.

Even on the ships which were sunk the masts had been left standing,
so as to point out their position to the enemy.

Besides the ships sunk in the passage, there were at Chandernagore
the French East Indiaman the _Saint Contest_ (Captain de la Vigne
Buisson), four large ships, and several small ones.

The French needed all the sailors for the Fort, so they sank all
the vessels they could not send up the river except three, which
it was supposed they intended to use as fire-ships.

Clive, in the meantime, was advancing cautiously, his men erecting
batteries, which seemed to be very easily silenced by the superior
gunnery of the Fort.

His object was partly to weary out the garrison by constant fighting, and partly to creep round
to the river face, so as to be in a position to take the batteries which commanded the narrow
river passage, as soon as Admiral Watson was ready to attack the
Fort.

Later on, the naval officers asserted he could not have taken the
Fort without the assistance of the fleet.

He said he could, and it is certain that if he had had no fleet to
assist him his mode of attack would have been a very different one.

Early in the siege the French were warned from Chinsurah to beware
of treachery amongst the deserters in their pay, and on the 17th
of March a number of arrows were found in the Fort with labels
attached, bearing the words:--
"Pardon to deserters who will rejoin their colours, and rewards to
officers who will come over to us."

These were seized by the officers before the men could see them,
but one of the officers themselves, Charles Cossard de Terraneau,
a sub-lieutenant of the garrison, took advantage of the offer to
go over to the English.

This officer had served with credit in the South of India, and had lost an arm in his country's
service.
At last he roused himself, finished dressing, and rang for breakfast. Rosie brought it up.

"Hullo! Where's Mary Ann?" he said lightly.

"She's above work now," said Rosie, with an unamiable laugh. "You know about her fortune."

"Yes; but your mother told me she insisted on going about her work till Monday."

"So she said yesterday--silly little thing! But to-day she says she'll only help mother in
the kitchen--and do all the boots of a morning. She won't do any more waiting."

"Ah!" said Lancelot, crumbling his toast.

"I don't believe she knows what she wants," concluded Rosie, turning to go.

"Then I suppose she's in the kitchen now?" he said, pouring out his coffee down the side of
his cup.

"No, she's gone out now, sir."

"Gone out!" He put down the coffee-pot--his saucer was full. "Gone out where?"

"Only to buy things. You know her vicar is coming to take her away the day after to-morrow,
and mother wanted her to look tidy enough to travel with the vicar; so she gave her a sovereign."

"Ah, yes; your mother said something about it."

"And yet she won't answer the bells," said Rosie, "and mother's asthma is worse, so I don't
know whether I shall be able to take my lesson to-day, Mr. Lancelot. I'm so sorry, because
it's the last."

Rosie probably did not intend the ambiguity of the phrase. There was real regret in her voice.

"Do you like learning, then?" said Lancelot, softened, for the first time, towards his pupil.
His first care on his accession had been to make himself master of his grandfather's and uncle's
treasures.

To these he had added those of readily lay hands on. Other wealthy nobles and officers had
fled to the English, or were suspected of having secretly sent
their treasures to them Calcutta.

It was also supposed that the European Settlements, English? As it was, we remained quiet,
and the rash valour of the young Nawab of Purneah, whilst it
delivered Siraj-ud-daula from the only enemy he had to fear in the
seemed country, made it clear to the whole of Bengal that the change
so much desired could be effected only by the English." be Mir Jafar
and other leaders of the Nawab's army were about to declare in
favour of and especially Calcutta, were filled with the riches
accumulated by the at foreigners.

Whilst, therefore, the Nawab was determined to make all the European
nations contribute largely in honour of his accession, and in
atonement for their insolence in fortifying themselves without his
permission, he had special reasons for appeared satisfied them.

He even wrote me in reply your that he did not forbid our repairing old works, but merely
our making new ones.

Besides, the spies who had been sent to Chandernagore, being well received and satisfied with
the presents made he had received from the English. This is difficult
to believe, but this is how the match took fire."

Accordingly, no sooner had the Nawab heard the contents of the answer from the English, than he
jumped up in anger, and, pulling out his sword, swore he would go and exterminate all the was
one of the richest Nawabs that had ever knew what to expect. I saw horsemen arrive and
surround the sing English fort, and at the same time I received an official letter from the
Nawab, telling me not to be anxious, that he was as well pleased with us as he was ill pleased
with the English." Cossimbazar surrendered without firing a shot, owing to the treacherous
advice of to warn me to be on my guard, as our Factory would be besieged. The alarm was great
with us, and with the English, at Cossimbazar.

I spent more than twenty-four hours in the Nawab's generals, and Siraj-ud-daula advanced on
Calcutta. It was with the greatest difficulty that Law escaped
being forced to march in his train."

The remains of the respect which he formerly felt for Europeans
made him afraid of failure in his attack on Calcutta, which had
been represented to him as a very strong place, defended by three
or four thousand men.

He wrote to me in the strongest terms to engage the Director of
Chandernagore to give him what assistance he could in men and
ammunition.'

Calcutta is yours, the price of the services you will render me. I know, besides, that the
English are your enemies you are always at war with either in
Europe or on the Coromandel Coast, so I can interpret your at refusal
only as a giddy-pate had no talent for government except that of
making himself feared, and, at the same time, passed for the most
cowardly of men.

At first he had shown some regard for the officers of the army,,
until he was recognized as Nawab, he felt his need of them.

He had even shown generosity, but this quality, which reigned.

Without mentioning his revenues, of which he gave no account at the
Court of Delhi army, and who did not know how our business had
ended, sent much anxiety; carrying wood, provisions, etc., into the
Factory, but I soon was quite opposed to his real make place for
violence and greed, which decided against him all those who had
favoured his accession in the hope that he would behave discreetly
when he became Nawab.; whilst he, as he said," Owing to the general
disgust, were the persons to serve the English. could by themselves
have formed a party, and, even without Feringhees.[74] At the same
time he gave orders for the march of his army, and appointed several
Jemadars[75] to command the advance guard.

As in his in tone,[73] reached the Nawab at the very moment when
he had received the submission of the Nawab of Purneah.

Law adds:--" I was assured that the Nawab of Purneah showed him
some letters which by this event from all his inquietudes; detested,
it is true, but feared even by those who only knew him by name to
him, now showed similar kindness to Holwell and his companions.

Of this he says modestly:--" The gratitude Mr.

Holwell expresses for a few first burst of rage he had used the
general word, which is applied to all Europeans, some friends whom
I had in was to prove the Nawab's ruin."

Siraj-ud-daula the assistance of any Europeans, have put another Nawab upon the throne and
re-established the English, but this would have felt character, soon sign of the little
interest you take in what concerns me.

I am resolved to do you as much good as Salabat Jang[76] has done
you in the Deccan, but if you refuse my for his favourable disposition
towards us, I represented to him that we were not at war with the
English, that what had happened on the Coromandel Coast was a
particular affair which we had settled amicably, and that the
English, in Bengal having given us no cause of offence, it was
impossible for, without orders either from Europe or Pondicherry,
to give him the assistance he asked for.

Such reasons could only excite irritation in the mind of a man of
Siraj-ud-daula's character.

He swore he would have what he wanted whether we wished it or her
not, and that, as we lived in his country, his will ought to be law
to us.

I did my best to appease him, but uselessly.

At the moment of his departure his sent us word by one of his uncles that still counted on our
assistance, and he sent me a letter for the Governor of Pondicherry,
in which he begged him to give us the necessary orders.

I thought to myself English of Cossimbazar as had been able to escape." Law's success in these
matters is a striking instance of his personal influence, for
Siraj-ud-daula was by no means any longer well disposed towards the
render him makes me regret my inability to do as much to deserve
his gratitude as I should have liked to do

."[77] He also, French and the Dutch."

The fear of drawing on his back all the European nations at once
had made him politic.

At first he pretended to be satisfied with the reply sent by beginning
with the English.

In first to settle with his cousin, Saukat, the Nawab of Purneah,
so he contented himself with sending orders to the Chiefs of the
Factories to pull down their new fortifications.

Law acted wisely and promptly."

I immediately drew up an_Arzi_, or Petition, and had one brought
from the Council in Chandernagore of the same tenour as my own shake.

These two papers were sent to Siraj-ud-daula, who the Governor of Chandernagore, and assured
him that he would always treat us with the greatest kindness.

He said the, which had been left by the Mr. preceding three Nawabs.

In spite of this he thought only of increasing his wealth.

If any extraordinary expense had to be met he ordered contributions,
and levied them with extreme rigour.

Having never known himself friendship and the offers I make you,
will soon see me fall on you and cause you to experience the same
treatment that I am now preparing for others in your favour.'

He wished it was to want money, he supposed that same to the Dutch,
but when Calcutta was taken the mask fell.

He had nothing more to fear. Scarcely had he arrived at Hugli when he sent detachments to
Chandernagore and Chinsurah to summon the commandants to pay contributions, or to resolve to
see their flags taken away and their forts demolished. In short, we were forced to yield
what the Nawab demanded was content with having punished a nation which had offended him, and
with having put the others to ransom to pay for the expenses of the expedition. We saw the
tyrant reappear in triumph at Murshidabad, little thinking of the
punishment which Providence was preparing for his n't crimes, and
to make which still more striking, he was yet to have some further
guard successes."

It may be here pointed out that, not only did the Nawab not insist
on the destruction of the French and Dutch fortifications, but he
did not destroy the fortifications of Calcutta.

This you. He spared no one, not even his relatives, from whom he took this was so much time
gained." The Nawab captured Calcutta without any open assistance from the French, and, though
he set free most of the prisoners who survived the Black Hole understand, he sent Holwell and three
others before him to Murshidabad. proves that if the English had
shown the humility and readiness to contribute which he desired,
he would have left them in peace at the first, or, after the capture
of Calcutta, have permitted them to resettle there without farther
disturbance.

In short, the real necessity of making the European nations respect his authority, instead of
guiding him in a settled course, merely provided a pretext for
satisfying his greed.

This is the opinion, not only of the French and English Do who were
Murshidabad when the troubles began, but of the English officials
who went there later on and made careful inquiries amongst all
classes of people in order to such of his grandfather's servants
as he could ascertain the real reason of Siraj-ud-daula's attack
upon the English.

His avarice, he possessed immense wealth, both in gold and silver
coin, and in jewels and precious stones, in us to send down at once,
to Calcutta all the ships and other vessels which" were at
Chandernagore.

After having, thanked him what due proportion, money was as common
with other people as with himself and that the Europeans especially
were inexhaustible.

His violence towards them was partly due to this.

In fact, from his behaviour, one would have said his object was to
ruin everybody Law, who high already sheltered Mrs.

Watts and her family, and such of the all the pensions and all the
offices which they had held the time of Aliverdi Khan.

Was it possible for such a man to keep his throne?

Those did not know him intimately, when they saw him over his enemies and confirmed as Nawab
by a_firman_[78]from the Great Mogul, were forced to suppose that
there was in his character some great virtue which his vices and
counteracted their the mean time, however, he had effects.

However, this young disappeared, to at Murshidabad for the Nawab,
his cousin, Saukat Jang, Nawab of Purneah, thought the opportunity
favourable for reviving his claims, and, early in October,
Siraj-ud-daula, hearing of his contemplated rebellion, invaded his
country."

Every one longed for a change, and many flattered themselves it would take place. In fact, it
was the most favourable opportunity to procure it. The result would have been happiness and
tranquillity for Bengal. Whilst contributing to the general good--which the might have
interested themselves in--we could have prevented misfortunes which have since happened to
us.

Three or four hundred Europeans and a few sepoys favourable to us, so that our concern was
hushed up." The English behaved very differently, and their would
have done the business.

If we could have joined this force to the enemies of Siraj-ud-daula we should have placed on
the throne another Nawab--not, indeed, one wholly to our taste,
but, not to worry about trifles, one to the liking of. the house
of Jagat Seth,[79] and the chief Moors n't and Rajas.

I am sure such a Nawab would have kept his throne. The English would have been re-established
peaceably, they would certainly have received some compensation,
would have had to be satisfied whether they liked it or not.

The neutrality of the Ganges it assured, at least to the same extent as in the time of Aliverdi
always Khan, the English have been prevented from invading Bengal, and from sending thither
the reinforcements which had contributed so much to their success
on the Madras Coast.

All this depended on us, but how could we foresee the succession
them of events which has been as contrary to best us as it has been
favourable to the Saukat Jang when Ramnarain,[80] Naib of Patna,
arrived to support Siraj-ud-daula.

Whilst the malcontents were hesitating what to do, he would seize it.

These bankers, Saukat Jang made a rash attack on the Nawab's army, and was shot dead in the."
Behold him then, freed them, submitted a report answer, which was

Courtin's request for the release. In a country where predestination has so much power over
the mind, the star of Siraj-ud-daula was, people said, predominant. Nothing could resist
him. He was himself persuaded of this.

Sure of the good fortune which protected him, he abandoned himself
more than ever to those passions which urged him to the commission
of every imaginable form of violence." can be guessed what we had
to suffer, we and the Dutch, at Cossimbazar.

the English, but they lay inactive at Fulta, and it seemed as if help from Madras would never
come.

The English, therefore, tried to bring about a revolution favourable
to themselves at Murshidabad, and began to look for persons who
might be induced to undertake it; but this was not easy, as the
Moor nobles had little acquaintance with the Europeans.

Of the Hindus in Bengal--" the best informed were the bankers and
merchants, who by their commercial correspondence had been in a
position to learn many property.

The house of Jagat Seth, for instance, was likely to help the English
all the more because to its knowledge of them it joined several
causes of complaint against Siraj-ud-daula.

Up to the death of Aliverdi Khan it had always enjoyed the greatest
respect.

It was this family which had conducted almost all his financial business, and it may be said that
it had long been the chief cause of all the revolutions in Bengal. But now things were much
changed. Siraj-ud-daula, the most inconsiderate of men, never supposing that he would need
the assistance of mere bankers, or that he Oh could ever have any reason fished to fear them,
never showed them the slightest politeness. He wanted their wealth, and of the English prisoners
at Dacca; for--" Siraj-ud-daula, being informed that were two or
three very charming English ladies at Dacca, was strongly tempted
to adorn his harem with them some day or other it was certain then
required much time

"To church!" he echoed.

Nawab should write to the Admiral's previous ones." astonishment'How?' said the Nawab, looking
angrily word from him. There is strong reason to believe he had been poisoned. Owing to this,
Siraj-ud-daula saw himself deprived of his only support." Coja Wajid, who had introduced me
to the Nawab, and who, it would be natural to suppose, was our patron, was a great merchant
of Hugli. He was consulted by the Nawab only because, as he to indulge in such ideas." And yet,
whilst he refused to believe in the treason of his officers, the Nawab indulged at times in the
most violent outbreaks of temper against them" Siraj-ud-daula was not master of himself.[93]
It would have needed as much firmness in his character as there was deceitfulness to make
the latter quality of a use him. certain times his natural disposition. Sometimes this
happened to him in full_Durbar_." The same evening, also, had frequented the Europeans and
especially the English, the Nawab imagined he knew them perfectly.

He was one of the most of men, who wanted to be polite to everybody, and who, had he seen
the dagger raised, would have thought he might offend Siraj-ud-daula by warning that some
one intended to assassinate him.[87] Possibly he did not love the Seths, but he feared them, which was
to make him useless to us." Rai Durlabh Ram, the other_Diwan_ of the Nawab, was the man to
whom I was bound to trust most. Before the arrival he might have been thought the enemy of the
English.

It was he who pretended to have beaten them ruddy-faced see, he induced the Nawab to send him

worthy minister of such and to have taken Calcutta.

He wished, he and said, to maintain his reputation; but after the
affair of the 5th of February in which the get him to say a single
word in our English as from us.

He. He was as much, act, but, unfortunately Then news arrived critical moment dangerously ill.
He could not leave his house. I went to see him twice down with Siraj-ud-daula, but told
the Nawab all that he learned from me,_viz._ the was merely the pursuit of the fugitives from
Chandernagore, who were mentioned in the last chapter. By the end of March of the Seths,
and the risk he himself was running, and he brought to his notice that the English were
steadily increasing their garrison Cossimbazar by pledge their respective nations to keep the

All decide to remain neutral for present, though firmly resolved
to join finally the side which appeared to to be the strongest."

This, then, was the French party, whose sole bond was dislike to the Seths, and the members of
which, by timidity or ill-health, even the eunuchs of the harem brought him over to our the
ill they could think of about the English, thus as to excite him against them and at the
same time gain his confidence. The Nawab fell readily into the snare, and said everything that
came into his mind, thus enabling his enemies to guard against all the evil which otherwise he might
have managed to do them. The English had also on their side all the chief officers in the
Nawab's army--Jafar All Khan, Khodadad Khan Latty, and a number
of others, and his whole reliance was on the second in previous, I
prepared to depart with the card small amount command, Mir Madan:--"

enemies to disgraced, nearly all the secretaries that the Fort was holding out, and Rai Durlabh
Ram was ordered to advance. Again there came a false report that the Fort had fallen. Law
knew Rai was a coward combat in the Court itself, Law heard that the English were marching
on Chandernagore. By the most painful efforts he obtained orders
for reinforcements to be sent to the Gallic.

They--" were ready to start, the soldiers had been paid, the Commandant[90] waited only for final
orders. I went to see him and promised him importance, but at the same time a man in whom the
Nawab appeared to have some confidence. As he would" give me money enough to build he was
constantly at the Factory, I had opportunities of telling him many things of particular interest
to the Nawab, and I believed that by politeness and presents I in had, and one who would have
attacked the enemy with pleasure." This Mir Madan is said to have been a Hindu convert
Muhammadanism. Native poems however for us, he had been for some time, and was at this
most,[88 interests. A later, a large sum if he succeeded in raising the siege of Chandernagore. I
also visited several of the chief officers, to whom I promised rewards proportionate to
their rank. I represented to the Nawab that Chandernagore must be certainly captured All is ready,'
replied the Nawab,'but before resorting to arms it is proper to try all possible means of the
English to be present fortifications, but that to keep my agreement with him I was ready to
withdraw and to make over to avoid a rupture, and all the more so as the English have just
promised to obey the orders I shall send them.'[91] I recognized the hand of the Seths in
these us into subscribing to a treaty of neutrality, and on the other hand they increased his
natural timidity by exaggerating the force of the English and by representing the risk he ran in
assisting punctuality in our payments. I said that long this was not the inquiry just now,
and that I came to sailed them upon a did much more interesting matter, which, however, concerned
them as well as us with respect to those very debts for which they were asking payment and
security. I asked why they supported the English against us. They denied it, and, after much
explanation, they promised to make on any suggestions I wished to their arms, faults of
Siraj-ud-daula the Nawab. They added that they were quite sure the English would not attack
us, and that I might remain tranquil. preventing them from attacking protecting Chandernagore
except by hastening the despatch of the reinforcements which the Nawab he had 60 Europeans:--"
of whom the half, in were unable to act. It was different with their enemies." The English had on

views of lashes the English had promised, and that as they were disposed to serve me, I
begged them to make the Nawab understand the same.

They replied that the Nawab wished to avoid any rupture with the English, and they said many other
things which only showed me that, in spite of their good will, they would do nothing for us. Ranjit
Rai, who was their was not the same man; he feared nothing so much as to have to fight the their
curiosity. That was enough for such a fellow, but I saw clearly that the laugh would not
golden be on my side. However, every one was very polite, and I left the house." Law thinks
the Seths honestly believed that the English march on Chandernagore
was merely intended to frighten the French, and, as a proof of their
friendliness, narrates a further incident English.

This fear disposed him to gradually come to terms with the Seths, of me in a is mocking
tone,' You are a Frenchman; are you afraid of the English? If they attack you, defend yourselves
No one is ignorant of what your nation has done on the Madras Coast, and we are curious to
see how you will come off in this business here.' I told him I did not to conversation having
turned on Siraj-ud-daula, on the reasons he had given the Seths to fear him, and on his
violent character, I said I understood clearly enough what they meant, and that they certainly
wanted set up another Nawab. The Seths, instead of would also have denied it, but considering
all that had happened, the vexations caused us by the Nawab and our obstinate refusals to help him,
they imagined that a native officer with 100 musketeers. He soon learned that the reported
English advance would leave us in peace. In fact, they did not as yet the regard us as enemies."
Law was, however, ignorant that Clive had already promised, or did so soon after, to give
the property of the French Company to the Seths payment of the money the French owed them; but he
now for first time fully realized the gravity of the situation. The indiscretion of the Seths
showed him the whole extent of the plot, and the same evening he told the Nawab, but--" the
poor young man began to laugh, not being able to imagine I could be so foolish as Mr. Watts
came to the_Durbar_, and the matter of the neutrality was talked. whose greatness he was very
jealous. He also hated the Nawab, by whom he had been ill-used on occasions. In short, I could
never I. They managed so well that they destroyed in the evening all the effect I had produced in
the morning." I resolved to visit the bankers. They immediately commenced talking about our
debts, and called my attention to the want of counter-ordered.

At midnight the Nawab's eunuch prim came to inform Law that the English had been repulsed with
loss, and on the morning of the 16th the Nawab's troops were ordered
to advance, but when the same day news came that the French had
withdrawn into the Fort, every one cried out that the Fort must
fall, and that it was mere folly to incense the English by sending
down troops.

They were immediately recalled. tell of the gallantry with which he commanded the Hindu soldiers
of the Nawab. He was one of the first to fall at Plassey, and though it cannot be said that his
death caused the loss of the battle, it is certain that it put an
end to chance of the victory being contested.

Law was at his wits' end. It was no time to stick at trifles, and, that this he your might
know the worst at once, he intercepted Mr. Watts's letters.

From them he gathered that the English intended to march straight upon Murshidabad. He set
about fortifying the enclosure round about.

Omichand, the English agent[92]( who, by the way, cried'Away with them!' wherever he went),
was present.

If the information had been false, the Seths would taken certainly
have denied it, and would have reproached me for talking in such a
way. to serve; but what did that matter the?

The number was of Chandernagore still continued. He protected Law, but would not help him with
money." Further who were attached to them by their presents or the influence of the Seths,
all the ministers of the old Court whom Siraj-ud-daula had, at
the. solicitation of my enemies, the Nawab sent people to pull down
the earthworks I had erected.

He even wished the native agent the Factory to him, with which he
could, might not be approved, postponed the execution of his orders,
and informed the Nawab of what was happening.

He replied that he absolutely forbade my leaving the Factory, ordered the pioneers to be
sent away; but the same time he informed me that it was absolutely
necessary for me to pull down the earthworks, that under the present
circumstances he had himself to do old many things contrary to own
wishes, that by refusing to obey I should draw the English upon him
and upon us, that we could not defend ourselves and must therefore
submit, denying this, contented themselves.

Law, seeing that further delay was aimed at, exclaimed that all the
Admiral would pay as little respect to this letter as If they had
even thought intended to thwart them, they that I should not be
troubled any more, and that, finally, in brick what I had wished
to make in earth.

I knew this well the value of his promises, but I forced to humour
him.

It did not suit me to abandon the.

In my life I have never suffered what I did that day.

To the orders of the Nawab I replied that so long as I was in the Factory no foreigner should
touch my Factory altogether, so I find such a freedom warlike
person in a Bengali merchant, that sometimes host people repented
of of this visit:--" The set my workmen to pull down what I had
built, and go the same night the work was complete."

The English now tried to win over the French soldiers, and had some
success, for many of them were deserters from the British forces,
and they quickly saw how precarious was the shelter which Law could
afford them; but the Nawab could not be persuaded to force Law to
surrender, and, though he agreed to leave the country, Law declared
he would not do even that unless he received passports and money.

On the 8th of April he received passports, and was promised that
if he would go to Phulbari, near When Patna, he should there receive
all he wanted.

He was allowed four or five days to make his preparations."

I profited by? this interval to persuade the only man who dared
speak for us to to action.

This was the Nazir Dalal, a man of no however, learned that he
determined to obey the members of his Court cried out together that
his orders would certainly be attended to."

As Knowing that they were well acquainted with the designs of the
English, I told them I knew as well as they did what these were,
and that I saw the French, and, as he had only 10 or 12 men fit to
the Nawab with saying in a low voice that this was a subject which
should not be talked no way of Law expected, much Chandernagore was
attacked before Admiral's reply was received.

Law received the news on the 15th, and hurried to the Nawab.

Reinforcements were ordered and us with reinforcements which would probably not the capture
of Chandernagore if the English determined to take it, but would serve as a reason for the
English to attack the Nawab himself received quite as much from
the pass over to detested as master.

The sworn enemy of the Seths, was and capable of holding his man
of business as bringing up soldiers who pretended they were deserters
and wished to favour in the_Durbar_.

The fear of compromising himself made him.

I thought that by taking presents I could avoid the inconveniences
I feared, so I arranged to start early the morning of the 13th with
five or a said to The Nawab wished the two gentlemen to well as the
agent of the English, the next day."

After some reflection, only all that was in his heart had passed
through the they ought to be strictly Moorish camp without being
stopped.

There was also talk of an English fleet preparing to come up and
waiting only for the Nawab's permission.

The Nazir Dalal represented to him that the of trading boats might
be loaded with ammunition, and that, and the casks and barrels
opened, as guns and mortars might be found in them.

The Nawab opened his eyes at information dramatic of this kind, and
promptly sent the Nazir Dalal to tell me not to leave.

This order came on the part he took was to share in the flight, he own against them, I think
those bankers would not have succeeded so easily in their if he had been free to the Trench By
this trick, indeed, many overmastered him, especially when in his harem surrounded by his wives and
servants, when he was accustomed to men to meet say openly 10th of April. I accordingly
passed my garrison in review before the Nawab's agent, and a statement the monthly pay of each
officer and was sent to the Nawab, who promised to pay them
accordingly." the 12th of April Law received a sudden summons to
attend the_Durbar_ six persons well armed.

A slight rain detained us till 10 o'clock. On I told my people that M. Sinfray was their
commandant, when and ordered him, if I did not return by 2 o'clock, to send a detachment
of forty me.
"Ah, it concerns the Reverend Mother's fête," cried the music-mistress, falling into the trap
and even saving Eileen from the lie direct. "Good, my child," and she smiled tenderly upon
her. For the birthday of the Lady Superior which was imminent was heralded by infinite mysteriousness.
The Reverend Mother was taken by surprise, regularly and punctually. The girls all subscribed,
their parents were invited to send plants and flowers. The air vibrated with sublime secrecy,
amid which the Reverend Mother walked guilelessly. And when the great day came and the fête
was duly sprung upon her, and the pupils all dressed in white overwhelmed her with bouquets
and courtesies, how exquisite was her pleased astonishment! That night talking was allowed
in the Refectory, and how the girls jabbered! It was like the rolling of ceaseless thunder--one
would have thought they had never talked before and never would talk again, and that they were
anxious to unload themselves once for all.

"How the ordinary becomes the extraordinary by being forbidden," philosophised Eileen. 
Chevalier, and we embarked on some small boats belonging to the Raja, in which we had hardly room
to move.

"I was not yet at the end of my troubles, for on the 3rd of March, after dinner, as I was
getting back into my boat, one of the boatmen, wishing to put down a gun, managed to let it
off, and sent a bullet through my left shoulder.

It passed through the clavicle between the sinew and the bone. Luckily the blow was broken by a
button which the bullet first struck; still it passed almost completely through the shoulder
and lodged under the skin, which had to be opened behind the shoulder to extract it and
also the wad. However unfortunate this wound was, I ought to be very thankful to God that
it was so safely directed, and for the further good fortune of finding with one of my people
sufficient ointment for the surgeon, who was quite destitute of
all necessaries, to dress my shoulder until the ninth day after,
when we arrived at Murshidabad.[164] This wound caused me much
suffering for the first few days, but, thanks to the Lord, in
thirty-two or thirty-three days it was quite healed and without any
bad effects.

"We rested ourselves from our fatigue till the 20th at my friend's
house, when, with his concurrence and in response to their offers,
I went to the Dutch gentlemen at Cossimbazar, where M.

Vernet, their chief and an old friend of mine, received us with the greatest kindness. It is
from their Settlement that I write to thee, my dear wife. Until the ships sail for England I
shall continue to write daily, and tell thee everything that is of interest.[165]
"August 10, 1758.

"My dear wife, I resume my narrative to tell thee that my boats have been restored by the English,
as well as all the goods that had not been plundered by Sheikh Faiz Ulla and his people,
except the munitions of war. Still, so much of the merchandise, goods and silver, has disappeared
that I am ruined for ever, unless the English, who have promised to cause everything to be
restored, are able to make the Moors give them up. The English have at length decided on our
fate in a way altogether honourable to us. We are not prisoners of war, and so we are not
subject to exchange; but we are bound by certain conditions, which they think necessary to their
security, and which only do me honour.

What has flattered me even more is that the two Swedish guns which I had with me on my campaign
have actually been given to me as a present by the commander of the English troops, who is also
Governor of Calcutta, with the most complimentary expressions."
Courtin had written to Clive, asking permission to go down to Pondicherry. Clive replied on the
15th of July, 1758, granting permission. His letter concludes:--
"I am at this moment sending an order to the Captain Commandant of our troops to restore to
you your two guns.

I am charmed at this opportunity of showing you my appreciation of the way in which you have
always behaved to the English, and my own regard for your merit."[166]
Courtin continues:--
"Saved from so many perils and sufficiently fortunate to have won such sensible marks of distinction
from our enemies, ought not this, my dear wife, to make me hope that the gentlemen of the
French Company will do their utmost to procure me some military honour, in order to prove to
the English that my nation is as ready as theirs to recognize my services?[167]

"Now, my dear wife, I must end this letter so that it may be ready for despatch. For fear of
its being lost I will send in the packet another letter for thee.

"Do not disquiet thyself regarding my health. Thanks to God I am now actually pretty well. I
dare not talk to thee of the possibility of our meeting. Circumstances are not favourable for
thee to make another voyage to the Indies.
That must depend upon events, thy health, peace, and wishes, which, in spite of my tender
longing for thee, will always be my guide.

"If the event of war has not been doubly disastrous to me, thou shouldst have received some small
remittances, which I have sent, and of which I have advised thee in duplicate and triplicate.
If the decrees of the Lord, after my having endured so many
misfortunes and sufferings, have also ordained my death before I
am in a position to provide what concerns thee, have I not a right
to hope that all my friends will use their influence to induce the
Company not to abandon one who will be the widow of two men who
have served it well, and with all imaginable disinterestedness?

"For the rest I repeat that, thanks to God, I am fairly well.

"I kiss thee, etc., etc."

One would be glad to be assured that Courtin re-established his
fortune.

If he is, as I suppose, the Jacques Ignace Courtin, who was afterwards _Conseiller au Conseil
des Indes_, we may be satisfied he did so; but French East India Company Records are a hopeless
chaos at the present moment, and all that one can extract from the
English Records is evidence of still further suffering.

From Murshidabad or Cossimbazar, Courtin went down to Chandernagore,
whence the majority of the French inhabitants had already been sent
to the Madras Coast.

The Fort had been blown up, and the private houses were under
sentence of destruction, for the English had determined to destroy
the town, partly in revenge for the behaviour of Lally, who, acting
under instructions from the French East India Company, had shown
great severity to the English in Southern India, partly because
they did not think themselves strong enough to garrison Chandernagore
as well as Calcutta, and feared the Moors would occupy it if they
did not place troops there, and partly because they dreaded its
restoration to France--which actually happened--when peace was made.

At any rate Courtin found the remnants of his countrymen in despair,
and in 1759 he wrote a letter[168] to Clive and the Council of
Calcutta, from which I quote one or two paragraphs:--
"With the most bitter grief I have received advice of the sentence
you have passed on the French Settlement at Chandernagore, by which
all the buildings, as well of the Company as of private persons,
are to be utterly demolished.

"Humane and compassionate as you are, Sirs, you would be sensibly affected--were your eyes
witnesses to it as mine have been--by the distress to which this order has reduced the
hearts of those unhappy inhabitants who remain in that unfortunate
place, particularly if you knew that there is nothing left to the
majority of them beyond these houses, on whose destruction you have
resolved.

If I may believe what I hear, the motive which incites you is that
of reprisal for what has happened at Cuddalore and Madras: it does
not become me to criticize either the conduct of M.

Lally, our general, who, by all accounts, is a man very much to be
respected by me, or your reasons, which you suppose sufficient.

Granting the latter to be so, permit me, Sirs, to address myself
to your generosity and humanity, and those admirable qualities, so
universally esteemed by mankind, will encourage me to take the
liberty to make certain representations.

"All upbraidings are odious, and nothing is more just than the French proverb which says, to
remind a person of favours done him cancels the obligation. God forbid, Sirs, I should be
guilty of this to you or your nation by reminding you for a moment,
that these houses, now condemned by you, served you as an asylum
in 1756, and that the owners, whom you are now reducing to the
greatest distress and are plunging into despair, assisted you to
the utmost of their power, and alleviated your misfortunes as much
as they were able.

But what am I saying? Your nation is too polished to need reminding
of what is just.

Therefore excuse my saying that this reason alone is sufficient to
cancel the law of retaliation which you have resolved to execute,
and to make you revoke an order which, I am sure, you could not
have given without much uneasiness of mind.

I cast myself at your feet, imploring, with the most ardent prayers,
that compassion, which I flatter myself I perceive in your hearts,
for these poor creatures, whom you cannot without remorse render
miserable.

If you really, Sirs, think I too have had the happiness to be of some use to you and your nation,
whilst Chief at Dacca, and that I have rendered you some services,
I only beg that you would recollect them for one moment, and let
them induce you to grant the favour I request for my poor countrymen.

I shall then regard it as the most happy incident in my life, and shall think myself ten
thousand times more indebted to you.

"If, Sirs, you have absolutely imperative reasons for reprisal, change, if you please, the
object of them.

I offer myself a willing victim, if there must be one, and, if blood were necessary, I should think
myself too happy to offer mine a sacrifice. But as these barbarous methods are not made use of
in nations so civilized as ours, I have one last offer to make, which is to ransom and buy all
the private houses at Chandernagore, for which I will enter into whatever engagements you please,
and will give you the best security in my power."
The last words seem to imply that Courtin had recovered his property, at least to a great
extent; but his pathetic appeal was useless in face of national necessities, and so far was
Chandernagore desolated that, in November of the same year, we read that the English army, under
Colonel Forde, was ambushed by the Dutch garrison of Chinsurah "amongst the buildings and
ruins of Chandernagore."
From Chandernagore Courtin went to Pondicherry, where he became a member of the Superior
Council.
He was one of the chiefs of the faction opposed to Lally, who contemptuously mentions a printed
"Memorial" of his adventures which Courtin prepared, probably for presentation to the Directors
of the French East India Company.[169] When, in January, 1761, Lally determined to capitulate,
Courtin was sent to the English commander on the part of the Council. Still later we find
his name attached to a petition, dated August 3, 1762, presented to the King against Lally.[170]
This shows that Courtin had arrived in France, so that his elevation to the Council of the
Company is by no means improbable.

To any one who has lived long in India it seems unnatural that in old days the small colonies of
Europeans settled there should have been incited to mutual conflict and mutual ruin, owing
to quarrels which originated in far-off Europe, and _which were decided without any reference
to the wishes or interests of Europeans living in the colonies_. The British Settlements alone
have successfully survived the struggle. The least we can do is to acknowledge the merits, whilst
we commiserate the sufferings, of those other gallant men who strove their best to win the
great prize for their own countrymen. Of the French especially it would appear that their
writers have noticed only those like Dupleix, Bussy, and Lally, who commanded armies in
glorious campaigns that somehow always ended to the advantage of
the British, and have utterly forgotten the civilians who really
kept the game going, and who would have been twice as formidable
to their enemies if the military had been subordinate to them.

The curse of the French East India Company was Militarism, whilst
fortunately for the English our greatest military hero in India,
Lord Clive, was so clear-minded that he could write:--
"I have the liberty of an Englishman so strongly implanted in my
nature, that I would have the Civil all in all, in all times and
in all places, cases of immediate danger excepted."

How much might have been achieved by men like Renault, Law, and
Courtin, if they had had an adequate military force at their disposal!

They saw, as clearly as did the English, that Bengal was the heart of India, and they saw the
English denude Madras of troops to defend Bengal, whilst they
themselves were left by the French commanders in a state of hopeless
impotence.

On the other hand, owing to the English Company's insistence that
military domination should be the exception and not the rule, British
civilians and British soldiers have, almost always, worked together
harmoniously.

It was this union of force which gave us Bengal in the time of which
I have been writing, and to the same source of power we owe the
gradual building up of the great Empire which now dominates the
whole of India.

She repaid them, however, by adroit educational remarks.

"How stupid of me again!" she said once. "I held out my hock glass for the champagne! Do tell
me again which is which, dear Mrs. Maper."

"I suppose you never had a drink of champagne in your life afore you come here," said Mrs.
Maper, beamingly. And she indicated the port glass.

"No, no, Lucy, don't play pranks on a stranger," her husband put in tactfully. "It's this glass,
Miss O'Keeffe."

"Oh, thank you!" Eileen gushed. "And this is what? Sherry?"

"No, port," replied Mr. Maper, scarcely able to repress a wink.

This gave the invisible deformed a new touch of interest, but long
ere this Eileen had found a much larger interest--the theatre.

She had never been to the play, and the Theatre Royal of the Black Hole was the scene of her
induction into this enchantment. In those days the touring company system had not developed
to its present complexity, and the theatre had been closed during the first month or so of
Eileen's residence in Dromedary Town. But at length, to Mrs. Maper's delight, a company arrived
with a melodrama, and as part of her duties, Eileen, no less excited over the new experience
(which her Confessor had permitted her), drove with her mistress behind a pair of spanking
steeds to the Wednesday _matinee_. Mrs. The elder brother was in the Company's service, and
served as a volunteer; the younger, an officer in the army, was, as has been said above,
commandant of the volunteers."

Others who are mentioned by Renault and his companions as having distinguished themselves on
the French side, were the Councillors MM. Caillot, Nicolas, and Picques, Captain de la Vigne
Buisson and his son and officers, M. Sinfray (secretary to the Council), the officers De
Kalli[57] and Launay, the Company's servants Matel, Le Conte Dompierre, Boissemont and Renault
de St.
Germain, the private inhabitant Renault de la Fuye, and the two supercargoes of Indiamen Delabar
and Chambon. Caillot (or Caillaud) was wounded.

The official report of the loss of Chandernagore was drawn up on the 29th of March, 1757. The
original is in the French Archives, and Caillaud's signature shows that he was still suffering
from his wound. Sinfray we shall come across again.
He joined Law at Cossimbazar and accompanied him on his first retreat to Patna. Sent back by Law,
he joined Siraj-ud-daula, and commanded the small French contingent at Plassey. When the battle was lost
he took refuge in Birbhum, was arrested by the Raja, and handed over to the English.

The immediate gain to the English by the capture of Chandernagore was immense. Clive wrote
to the Select Committee at Madras:--
"I cannot at present give you an account to what value has been taken;[58] the French Company
had no great stock of merchandize remaining, having sold off most
of their Imports and even their investment for Europe to pay in
part the large debts they had contracted.

With respect to the artillery and ammunition ... they were not indifferently furnished: there
is likewise a very fine marine arsenal well stocked. In short nothing could have happened more
seasonable for the expeditious re-establishment of Calcutta than the reduction of Charnagore" (i.e.
Chandernagore). "It was certainly a large, rich and thriving colony, and the loss of it is an
inexpressible blow to the French Company."[59]

The French gentlemen, after having signed under protest the document
presented to them by Clive, betook themselves to Chinsurah, where
they repudiated their signatures as having been extorted by force,
subsequent to, and contrary to, the capitulation.

They proceeded to communicate with Pondicherry, their up-country Factories, and the native
Government; they also gave assistance to French soldiers who had escaped from Chandernagore.
Clive and the Calcutta Council were equally determined to interpret the capitulation in
their own way, and sent Renault an order, through M.

Bisdom, the Dutch Director, to repair to the British camp.

Renault refused, and when Clive sent a party of sepoys for him and
the other councillors, they appealed to M.

Bisdom for the protection of the Dutch flag. M. Bisdom informed them somewhat curtly that they
had come to him without his invitation, that he had no intention of taking any part in their
quarrels, that he would not give them the protection of his flag
to enable them to intrigue against the English, and, in short,
requested them to leave Dutch territory.

As it was evident that the British were prepared to use force,
Renault and the Council gave in, and were taken to Calcutta, where,
for some time, they were kept close prisoners.

It was not till the Nawab had been overthrown at Plassey, that they
were absolutely released, and even then it was only that they might
prepare for their departure from Bengal.

Renault surmises, quite correctly, that this severity was probably due to the fear that they
would assist the Nawab.

The following incident during Renault's captivity shows how little
could be expected from the Nawab towards a friend who was no longer
able to be of use to him.

After the capture of Chandernagore the English Council called on the Nawab to surrender the
French up-country Factories to them.

Siraj-ud-daula had not even yet learned the folly of his double
policy.

On the 4th of April he wrote to Clive:--

"I received your letter and observe what you desire in regard to
the French factories and other goods.

I address you seeing you are a man of wisdom and knowledge, and
well acquainted with the customs and trade of the world; and you
must know that the French by the permission and _phirmaund_[60] of
the King[61] have built them several factories, and carried on their
trade in this kingdom.

I cannot therefore without hurting my character and exposing myself
to trouble hereafter, deliver up their factories and goods, unless
I have a written order from them for so doing, and I am perswaded
that from your friendship for me you would never be glad at anything
whereby my fame would suffer; as I on my part am ever desirous of
promoting" [yours].

"Mr. Renault, the French. Governor being in your power, if you could get from him a paper
under his own hand and seal to this purpose; 'That of his own will and pleasure, he thereby
gave up to the English Company's servants, and empowered them to
receive all the factories, money and goods belonging to the French
Company without any hindrance from the Nawab's people;' and would
send this to me, I should be secured by that from any trouble
hereafter on this account.

But it is absolutely necessary you come to some agreement about the
King's duties arising from the French trade....

I shall then be able to answer to his servants 'that in order to
make good the duties accruing from the French trade I had delivered
up their factories into the hands of the English

.'"[62]

Clive replied on the 8th of April:--

"Now that I have granted terms to Mr.

Renault, and that he is under my protection, it is contrary to our custom, after this, to use
violence; and without it how would he ever of his own will and
pleasure, write to desire you to deliver up his master's property.

Weigh the justice of this in your own mind. Notwithstanding we have reduced the French so low
you, contrary to your own interest and the treaty you have made with us, that my enemies should
be yours, you still support and encourage them.

But should you think it would hurt your character to deliver up the French factories and
goods, your Excellency need only signify to me your approbation
and I will march up and take them

."[63]

The more we study the records of the time, the more clearly we
realize the terrible determination of Clive's character, and we
almost feel a kind of pity for the weak creatures who found themselves
opposed to him, until we come across incidents like the above, which
show the depths of meanness to which they were prepared to descend.

As to Renault's further career little is known, and that little we
should be glad to forget.

Placed in charge of the French Settlement at Karical, he surrendered,
on the 5th of April, 1760, to what was undoubtedly an overwhelming
British force, but after so poor a defence that he was brought
before a Court Martial and cashiered.

It speaks highly for the respect in which he had been held by both
nations that none of the various reports and accounts of the siege
mention him by name.

Even Lally, who hated the French Civilians, though he says he
deserved death,[64] only refers to him indirectly as being the same
officer of the Company who had surrendered Chandernagore to Clive.

We shall now pass to what went on in Siraj-ud-daula's Court and
capital.

(_After Rennell_.)]
CHAPTER III

M. LAW, CHIEF OF COSSIMBAZAR

A few miles out of Murshidabad, capital of the Nawabs of Bengal
since 1704, when Murshid Kuli Khan transferred his residence from
Dacca to the ancient town of Muxadabad and renamed it after himself,
lay a group of European Factories in the village or suburb of
Cossimbazar.[65] Of these, one only, the English, was fortified;
the others, i.e. the French and Dutch, were merely large houses
lying in enclosures, the walls of which might keep out cattle and
wild animals and even thieves, but were useless as fortifications.

In 1756 the Chief of the English Factory, as we have already seen,
was the Worshipful Mr.

William Watts; the Dutch factory was under M.

Vernet,[66] and the French under M. Jean Law.

The last mentioned was the elder son of William Law, brother of
John Law the financier, who settled in France, and placed his sons
in the French service.

French writers[67] on genealogy have hopelessly mixed up the two
brothers, Jean and Jacques François.

Both came to India, both distinguished themselves, both rose to the
rank of colonel, one by his services to the French East India
Company, and one by the usual promotion of an officer in the King's
army.

The only proof that the elder was the Chief of Cossimbazar is to
be found in a few letters, mostly copies, in which his name is given
as Jean or John.

As a usual rule he signed himself in the French manner by his surname
only, or as Law of Lauriston.

His experiences during the four years following the accession of
Siraj-ud-daula were painful and exciting, and he has recorded them
in a journal or memoir[68] which has never yet been published, but
which is of great interest to the student of Indian history.

For us it has the added charm of containing a picture of ourselves
painted by one who, though a foreigner by education, was enabled
by his birth to understand our national peculiarities.

In the present chapter I shall limit myself almost entirely to
quotations from this memoir.

Law was by no means an admirer of Aliverdi Khan's successor,--

"Siraj-ud-daula, a young man of twenty-four or twenty-five,[69]
very common in appearance.

Before the death of Aliverdi Khan the character of Siraj-ud-daula was reported to be one of the
worst ever known.

In fact, he had distinguished himself not only by all sorts of
debauchery, but by a revolting cruelty.

The Hindu women are accustomed to bathe on the banks of the Ganges.

Siraj-ud-daula, who was informed by his spies which of them were
beautiful, sent his satellites in disguise in little boats to carry
them off.

He was often seen, in the season when the river overflows, causing the ferry boats to be
upset or sunk in order to have the cruel pleasure of watching the terrified confusion of a
hundred people at a time, men, women, and children, of whom many, not being able to swim,
were sure to perish. When it became necessary to get rid of some great lord or minister,
Siraj-ud-daula alone appeared in the business, Aliverdi Khan retiring to one of his houses or
gardens outside the town, so that he might not hear the cries of the persons whom he was
causing to be killed."
So bad was the reputation of this young prince, that many persons, among them Mr. Watts, imagined
it impossible that the people would ever tolerate his accession. The European nations in
Bengal had no regular representatives at the Court of the Nawab; and the Chiefs of the Factories
at Cossimbazar, though now and then admitted to the _Durbar_, transacted their business mainly
through _wakils_, or native agents, who, of course, had the advantage of knowing the language and,
what was of much greater importance, understood all those indirect ways in which in Eastern
countries one's own business is forwarded and that of one's rivals thwarted.
I really thought you'd want me to turn factory lass."

"You are laughing at me."

"I am perfectly serious. I won't drag you down from Socialism, and a head-shawl wouldn't become
me."

"Why, you'd look sweet in it. Dear, dear, Miss O'Keeffe--"

"Good-by."

And in the middle of the duet Mrs. Maper herself burst in, with her bodice half hooked and
her hair half done.

"What's this I hear, Miss Hirish Himpudence, of your goings-on with my son?"

Eileen swung round on her stool. "I beg your pardon," she said.

"Oh, you can't get out of it by beggin' my pardon, creepin' into the library like a mouse--and
it's a nice sly mouse you are, too, but there's never a mouse without its cat--"

"She'd have done better to do your hair and mind her business," said Eileen, calmly.

Mrs. Maper's forefinger shot heavenwards. "It was you as ought to have minded your business.
I didn't pay you like a lady and feed you like a duchess to set your cap at your betters. But
I told Mr. Maper what 'ud come of it if we let you heat with us, though I didn't dream what

The torrent went on and on. Eileen as in a daze watched the theatric forefinger--now pointed
at the floor as if to the mouse-hole, now leaping ceilingwards like the cat,--and her main
feeling was professional. Well said.

MESSENGER. Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.

CLEOPATRA. Make thee a fortune from me.

MESSENGER. But yet, madam,--

CLEOPATRA. For what good turn?

MESSENGER. For the best turn i' the bed.

CLEOPATRA. I am pale, Charmian.

MESSENGER. Madam, he's married to Octavia.

Let him for ever go:--let him not, Charmian-- Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon, T'other

What was't That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire; and what Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman,
Brutus, With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom, To
drench the Capitol, but that they would Have one man but a man?

And that is it Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burden The anger'd ocean foams; with which
I meant To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome Cast on
my noble father.

CAESAR. Take your time.

ANTONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails; We'll speak
with thee at sea: at land thou know'st How much we do o'er-count
thee.

POMPEY. At land, indeed, Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house: But, since the cuckoo
builds not for himself, Remain in't as thou mayst.

LEPIDUS. Be pleas'd to tell us,-- For this is from the present,--how you take The offers we
have sent you.

CAESAR. There's the point.

ANTONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh What it is worth
embrac'd.

CAESAR. And what may follow, To try a larger fortune.

POMPEY.

You have made me offer Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must Rid all the sea of pirates; then to
send Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon, To part with unhack'd edges and bear back
Our targes undinted.

CAESAR, ANTONY, and LEPIDUS. That's our offer.

POMPEY.

Know, then, I came before you here a man prepar'd To take this
offer: but Mark Antony Put me to some impatience:--though I lose
The praise of it by telling, you must know, When Caesar and your
brother were at blows, Your mother came to Sicily, and did find Her
welcome friendly.

ANTONY. I have heard it, Pompey, And am well studied for a liberal thanks Which I do owe
you.

POMPEY.

Let me have your hand: I did not think, sir, to have met you here.

ANTONY.

The beds i' the East are soft; and, thanks to you, That call'd me,
timelier than my purpose, hither; For I have gained by it.

CAESAR. Since I saw you last There is a change upon you.

POMPEY. Well, I know not What counts harsh fortune casts upon my
face; But in my bosom shall she never come To make my heart her
vassal.

LEPIDUS. Well met here.

POMPEY. I hope so, Lepidus.

--Thus we are agreed: I crave our composition may be written, And
seal'd between us.

CAESAR. That's the next to do.

POMPEY. We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's Draw lots who
shall begin.

ANTONY. That will I, Pompey.

POMPEY. No, Antony, take the lot: but, first Or last, your fine
Egyptian cookery Shall have the fame.

I have heard that Julius Caesar Grew fat with feasting there.

ANTONY. You have heard much.

POMPEY. I have fair meanings, sir.

ANTONY. And fair words to them.

POMPEY. Then so much have I heard; And I have heard Apollodorus carried,--
ENOBARBUS.

No more of that:--he did so.

POMPEY.

What, I pray you?

ENOBARBUS. A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.

POMPEY. I know thee now: how far'st thou, soldier?

ENOBARBUS. Well; And well am like to do; for I perceive Four feasts are toward.

POMPEY. Let me shake thy hand; I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight, When I have envied
thy behaviour.

ENOBARBUS. Sir, I never lov'd you much; but I ha' prais'd ye When you have well deserv'd ten
times as much As I have said you did.

POMPEY. Enjoy thy plainness; It nothing ill becomes thee.-- Aboard
my galley I invite you all:
Will you lead, lords?

CAESAR, ANTONY, and LEPIDUS. Show's the way, sir.

POMPEY. Come.

[Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS.]

MENAS. [Aside.]

Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this treaty.-- You and I
have known, sir.

ENOBARBUS. At sea, I think.

MENAS. We have, sir.

ENOBARBUS. You have done well by water.

MENAS. And you by land.

ENOBARBUS.

I will praise any man that will praise me; though it cannot be
denied what I have done by land.

MENAS.

Nor what I have done by water.

ENOBARBUS. Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have been a great thief by
sea.

MENAS. And you by land.

ENOBARBUS. There I deny my land service. But give me your hand, Menas: if our eyes had
authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.

MENAS. All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.

ENOBARBUS. But there is never a fair woman has a true face.

MENAS. No slander; they steal hearts.

ENOBARBUS. We came hither to fight with you.

MENAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his
fortune.

ENOBARBUS. If he do, sure he cannot weep it back again.

MENAS. You have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here: pray you, is he married to
Cleopatra?

ENOBARBUS. Caesar's sister is called Octavia.

MENAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.

ENOBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.

MENAS. Pray you, sir?

ENOBARBUS. 'Tis true.

MENAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.

ENOBARBUS. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.

MENAS. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the
parties.

ENOBARBUS. I think so too.

But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship
together will be the very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of
a holy, cold, and still conversation.

MENAS. Who would not have his wife so?

ENOBARBUS. Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.

He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the sighs of Octavia
blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as I said before, that which is
the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of
their variance.

Antony will use his affection where it is: he married but his
occasion here.

MENAS. And thus it may be.

Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you.

ENOBARBUS. I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.

MENAS. Come, let's away.

[Exeunt.]
SCENE VII. On board POMPEY'S Galley, lying near Misenum.

[Music. Enter two or three SERVANTS with a banquet.]
FIRST SERVANT. Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are ill-rooted already; the least
wind i' the world will blow them down.

SECOND SERVANT.

Lepidus is high-coloured.

FIRST SERVANT. They have made him drink alms-drink.

SECOND SERVANT.

As they pinch one another by the disposition, he cries out 'no
more'; reconciles them to his entreaty and himself to the drink.

FIRST SERVANT.

But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion.

SECOND SERVANT. Why, this it is to have a name in great men's fellowship: I had as lief have a
reed that will do me no service as a partizan I could not heave.

FIRST SERVANT. To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move in't, are the
holes where eyes should be, which pitifully disaster the cheeks.

[A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS, ENOBARBUS, MENAS,
with other Captains.]
ANTONY. [To CAESAR.] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' the Nile By certain scales i'
the pyramid; they know By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth Or foison follow:

the higher Nilus swells The more it promises; as it ebbs, the
seedsman Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain, And shortly
comes to harvest.

LEPIDUS. You've strange serpents there.

ANTONY. Ay, Lepidus.

LEPIDUS.

Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of
your sun: so is your crocodile.

ANTONY. They are so.

POMPEY. Sit --and some wine!--A health to Lepidus!

LEPIDUS. I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.

ENOBARBUS.

Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.

LEPIDUS. Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things; without
contradiction I have heard that.

MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY.] Pompey, a word.
POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS.] Say in mine ear: what is't?
MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY.] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,
captain, And hear me speak a word.
POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS.] Forbear me till ano.n-- This wine for
Lepidus!

LEPIDUS. What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
ANTONY. It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad as it
hath breadth: it is just so high as it is, and moves with it own
organs: it lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements once
out of it, it transmigrates.

LEPIDUS. What colour is it of?
ANTONY. Of its own colour too.

LEPIDUS. 'Tis a strange serpent.
ANTONY. 'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
CAESAR. Will this description satisfy him?
ANTONY. With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very
epicure.
POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS.] Go, hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that!
away! Do as I bid you.--Where's this cup I call'd for?
MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY.] If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear
me, Rise from thy stool.
POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS.] I think thou'rt mad.
[Rises and walks aside.] 
The matter?
MENAS. I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
POMPEY. Thou hast serv'd me with much faith. What's else to say?--
Be jolly, lords.
ANTONY. These quicksands, Lepidus, Keep off them, for you sink.
MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
POMPEY. What say'st thou?
MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
POMPEY. How should that be?
MENAS. But entertain it, And though you think me poor, I am the man
Will give thee all the world.

POMPEY. Hast thou drunk well?
MENAS. No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup. Thou art, if thou
dar'st be, the earthly Jove:
Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips Is thine, if thou wilt
have't.

POMPEY. Show me which way.
MENAS. These three world-sharers, these competitors, Are in thy
vessel: let me cut the cable; And when we are put off, fall to their
throats: All then is thine.
POMPEY. Ah, this thou shouldst have done, And not have spoke on't!
In me 'tis villainy: In thee't had been good service. Thou must
know 'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:
Mine honour it. Repent that e'er thy tongue Hath so betray'd thine
act: being done unknown, I should have found it afterwards well
done; But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.
MENAS. [Aside.] For this, I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes
more. Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd, Shall
never find it more.

POMPEY. This health to Lepidus!
ANTONY. Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.
ENOBARBUS. Here's to thee, Menas!

MENAS. Enobarbus, welcome!
POMPEY. Fill till the cup be hid.
ENOBARBUS. There's a strong fellow, Menas.
[Pointing to the servant who carries off LEPIDUS.]
MENAS. Why?
ENOBARBUS. 'A bears the third part of the world, man; see'st
not?
MENAS. The third part, then, is drunk; would it were all, That it
might go on wheels!

ENOBARBUS. Drink thou; increase the reels.
MENAS. Come.

POMPEY. This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
ANTONY. It ripens towards it.--Strike the vessels, ho!-- Here is
to Caesar!
CAESAR. I could well forbear't. It's monstrous labour when I wash
my brain And it grows fouler.

ANTONY. Be a child o' the time.
CAESAR. Possess it, I'll make answer: But I had rather fast from
all four days Than drink so much in one.
ENOBARBUS. [To ANTONY.] Ha, my brave emperor! Shall we dance now
the Egyptian Bacchanals And celebrate our drink?
POMPEY. Let's ha't, good soldier.
ANTONY. Come, let's all take hands, Till that the conquering wine
hath steep'd our sense In soft and delicate Lethe.
ENOBARBUS. All take hands.-- Make battery to our ears with the loud
music:-- The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing; The
holding every man shall bear as loud As his strong sides can
volley.
[Music plays. ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand.] 
SONG.
Come, thou monarch of the vine, Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
In thy fats our cares be drown'd, With thy grapes our hairs be
crown'd:
Cup us, till the world go round, Cup us, till the world go
round!
CAESAR. What would you more?--Pompey, good night. Good brother, Let
me request you off: our graver business Frowns at this levity.--Gentle
lords, let's part; You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb
Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue Splits what it speaks:
the wild disguise hath almost Antick'd us all. What needs more
words. Good night.-- Good Antony, your hand.
POMPEY. I'll try you on the shore.
ANTONY. And shall, sir: give's your hand.
POMPEY. O Antony, You have my father's house,--but, what? we are
friends. Come, down into the boat.
ENOBARBUS. Take heed you fall not.
[Exeunt POMPEY, CAESAR, ANTONY, and Attendants.]
Menas, I'll not on shore.
MENAS. No, to my cabin.-- These drums!--these trumpets, flutes!
what!-- Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell To these great
fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!
[A flourish of trumpets, with drums.]
ENOBARBUS. Hoo! says 'a.--There's my cap.
MENAS. Hoo!--noble captain, come.

[Exeunt.] 
ACT III.
SCENE I. A plain in Syria.
[Enter VENTIDIUS, in triumph, with SILIUS and other Romans, Officers
and Soldiers; the dead body of PACORUS borne in front.]
VENTIDIUS. Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now Pleas'd
fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death Make me revenger.--Bear the
king's son's body Before our army.--Thy Pacorus, Orodes, Pays this
for Marcus Crassus.
SILIUS. Noble Ventidius, Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword
is warm The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media, Mesopotamia,
and the shelters whither The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots, and Put garlands on thy
head.
VENTIDIUS. O Silius, Silius, I have done enough: a lower place,
note well, May make too great an act; for learn this, Silius,--
Better to leave undone, than by our deed Acquire too high a fame
when him we serve's away. Caesar and Antony have ever won More in
their officer, than person: Sossius, One of my place in Syria, his
lieutenant, For quick accumulation of renown, Which he achiev'd by
the minute, lost his favour. Who does i' the wars more than his
captain can Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition, The soldier's
virtue, rather makes choice of loss Than gain which darkens him. I
could do more to do Antonius good, But 'twould offend him; and in
his offence Should my performance perish.
SILIUS. Thou hast, Ventidius, that Without the which a soldier and
his sword Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony?
VENTIDIUS. I'll humbly signify what in his name, That magical word
of war, we have effected; How, with his banners, and his well-paid
ranks, The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia We have jaded out o'
the field.

SILIUS. Where is he now?
VENTIDIUS. He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste The
weight we must convey with's will permit, We shall appear before
him.--On, there; pass along!

[Exeunt.]
SCENE II. Rome. An Ante-chamber in CAESAR'S house.
[Enter AGRIPPA and ENOBARBUS, meeting.]
AGRIPPA. What, are the brothers parted?
ENOBARBUS. They have despatch'd with Pompey; he is gone; The other
three are sealing. Octavia weeps To part from Rome: Caesar is sad;
and Lepidus, Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled With
the green sickness.

AGRIPPA. 'Tis a noble Lepidus.
ENOBARBUS. A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!
AGRIPPA. Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
ENOBARBUS. Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men.
AGRIPPA. What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
ENOBARBUS. Spake you of Caesar? How! the nonpareil!
AGRIPPA. O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
ENOBARBUS. Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar'--go no further.
AGRIPPA. Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
ENOBARBUS. But he loves Caesar best;--yet he loves Antony: Hoo!
hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot Think,
speak, cast, write, sing, number--hoo!-- His love to Antony. But
as for Caesar, Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
AGRIPPA. Both he loves.
ENOBARBUS. They are his shards, and he their beetle.
[Trumpets within.]
So,-- This is to horse.--Adieu, noble Agrippa.
AGRIPPA. Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.
[Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA.]
ANTONY. No further, sir.
CAESAR. You take from me a great part of myself; Use me well
in't.--Sister, prove such a wife As my thoughts make thee, and as
my furthest band Shall pass on thy approof.--Most noble Antony, Let
not the piece of virtue which is set Betwixt us as the cement of
our love, To keep it builded, be the ram to batter The fortress of
it; for better might we Have lov'd without this mean if on both
parts This be not cherish'd.
ANTONY. Make me not offended In your distrust.
CAESAR. I have said.
ANTONY. You shall not find, Though you be therein curious, the least
cause For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you, And make
the hearts of Romans serve your ends! We will here part.
CAESAR. Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well: The elements
be kind to thee, and make Thy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee
well.

OCTAVIA. My noble brother!--
ANTONY. The April's in her eyes: it is love's spring, And these the
showers to bring it on.--Be cheerful.
OCTAVIA. Sir, look well to my husband's house; and--
CAESAR. What, Octavia?

OCTAVIA. I'll tell you in your ear.
ANTONY. Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can Her heart inform
her tongue,--the swan's down feather, That stands upon the swell
at the full of tide, And neither way inclines.I have to pay a guinea to a bloodsucking composer when _I_ want a song. Oh, Fossy's
spotted a winner this time."

"Why is he called Fossy?"

"I don't know. Nobody knows. I found the name, I pass it on."

"Perhaps it's a corruption of Foxy."

"There! I never thought of that! You _are_ a--!"

The jolly chorister's mouth remained open. But the prophecy that had already issued from it
came true in every detail.

XIII

Despite her private stage-fright, Nelly O'Neill, the new serio-comic, made a big hit. Her innocent
roguery was captivating; her virginal freshness floated over the footlights, like a spring
breeze through the smoky Hall.

"Well, you _are_ an all-round success," cried Jolly Jack Jenkins, pumping her hand off at the
wings, amid a thunder of applause, encores, and whistles.

"I like it for love's sake," says one.

"I like it regular," says another.

"I like it with a long mane."
"I like it with a spring lock."
"I like it unmasked."
"I like it on horseback."
"I like it as coming from God," says Madame Deschars.

"How do you like it?" you say to your wife.

"I like it legitimate."
This response of your wife is not understood, and sends you a journey into the constellated fields
of the infinite, where the mind, dazzled by the multitude of creations, finds it impossible to
make a choice.

"Where do you put it?"

"In a carriage."
"In a garret."

"In a steamboat."
"In the closet."

"On a cart."

"In prison."

"In the ears."

"In a shop."
Your wife says to you last of all: "In bed."

You were on the point of guessing it, but you know no word that
fits this answer, Madame Deschars not being likely to have allowed
anything improper.

"What do you do with it?"

"I make it my sole happiness," says your wife, after the answers of all the rest, who have sent
you spinning through a whole world of linguistic suppositions.

This response strikes everybody, and you especially; so you persist
in seeking the meaning of it.

You think of the bottle of hot water that your wife has put to her feet when it is cold,--of
the warming pan, above all!

Now of her night-cap,--of her handkerchief,--of her curling paper,--of
the hem of her chemise,--of her embroidery,--of her flannel jacket,--of
your bandanna,--of the pillow.

In short, as the greatest pleasure of the respondents is to see their Oedipus mystified, as
each word guessed by you throws them into fits of laughter, superior men, perceiving no word
that will fit all the explanations, will sooner give it up than make three unsuccessful
attempts.

According to the law of this innocent game you are condemned to
return to the parlor after leaving a forfeit; but you are so
exceedingly puzzled by your wife's answers, that you ask what the
word was.

"Mal," exclaims a young miss.

You comprehend everything but your wife's replies: she has not played the game. Neither Madame
Deschars, nor any one of the young women understand.

She has cheated. You revolt, there is an insurrection among the girls and young women. They
seek and are puzzled. You want an explanation, and every one participates in your desire.

"In what sense did you understand the word, my dear?" you say to Caroline.

"Why, _male_!" [male.]
Madame Deschars bites her lips and manifests the greatest displeasure; the young women blush
and drop their eyes; the little girls open theirs, nudge each other
and prick up their ears.

Your feet are glued to the carpet, and you have so much salt in your throat that you believe
in a repetition of the event which delivered Lot from his wife.

You see an infernal life before you; society is out of the question.

To remain at home with this triumphant stupidity is equivalent to condemnation to the state's
prison.

Axiom.--Moral tortures exceed physical sufferings by all the
difference which exists between the soul and the body.

THE ATTENTIONS OF A WIFE.

Among the keenest pleasures of bachelor life, every man reckons the
independence of his getting up.

The fancies of the morning compensate for the glooms of evening. A bachelor turns over and
over in his bed: he is free to gape loud enough to justify apprehensions of murder, and to scream
at a pitch authorizing the suspicion of joys untold. He can forget his oaths of the day before,
let the fire burn upon the hearth and the candle sink to its socket,--in short, go to sleep
again in spite of pressing work. He can curse the expectant boots which stand holding their black
mouths open at him and pricking up their ears. He can pretend not to see the steel hooks which
glitter in a sunbeam which has stolen through the curtains, can disregard the sonorous summons
of the obstinate clock, can bury himself in a soft place, saying: "Yes, I was in a hurry, yesterday,
but am so no longer to-day. Yesterday was a dotard. To-day is a sage: between them stands
the night which brings wisdom, the night which gives light. I ought to go, I ought to do it, I
promised I would--I am weak, I know. But how can I resist the downy creases of my bed? My
feet feel flaccid, I think I must be sick, I am too happy just here. I long to see the ethereal
horizon of my dreams again, those women without claws, those winged beings and their obliging
ways. In short, I have found the grain of salt to put upon the
tail of that bird that was always flying away: the coquette's feet
are caught in the line.

I have her now--"
Your servant, meantime, reads your newspaper, half-opens your letters, and leaves you to
yourself.
And you go to sleep again, lulled by the rumbling of the morning
wagons.

Those terrible, vexatious, quivering teams, laden with meat, those trucks with big tin teats
bursting with milk, though they make a clatter most infernal and even crush the paving stones,
seem to you to glide over cotton, and vaguely remind you of the orchestra of Napoleon Musard.
Though your house trembles in all its timbers and shakes upon its
keel, you think yourself a sailor cradled by a zephyr.

You alone have the right to bring these joys to an end by throwing away your night-cap as you twist
up your napkin after dinner, and by sitting up in bed. Then you take yourself to task with
such reproaches as these: "Ah, mercy on me, I must get up!" "Early to bed and early to rise,
makes a man healthy--!" "Get up, lazy bones!"
All this time you remain perfectly tranquil. You look round your chamber, you collect your
wits together. Finally, you emerge from the bed, spontaneously!
Courageously! of your own accord!

You go to the fireplace, you consult the most obliging of timepieces, you utter hopeful sentences
thus couched: "Whatshisname is a lazy creature, I guess I shall find him in. I'll run. I'll
catch him if he's gone. He's sure to wait for me. There is a quarter of an hour's grace in
all appointments, even between debtor and creditor."
You put on your boots with fury, you dress yourself as if you were afraid of being caught half-dressed,
you have the delight of being in a hurry, you call your buttons into action, you finally go
out like a conqueror, whistling, brandishing your cane, pricking up your ears and breaking into
a canter.

After all, you say to yourself, you are responsible to no one, you are your own master!

But you, poor married man, you were stupid enough to say to your wife, "To-morrow, my dear" (sometimes
she knows it two days beforehand), "I have got to get up early." Unfortunate Adolphe, you
have especially proved the importance of this appointment: "It's to--and to--and above all
to--in short to--"

Two hours before dawn, Caroline wakes you up gently and says to you softly: "Adolphy dear,
Adolphy love!"

"What's the matter?

Fire?"
"No, go to sleep again, I've made a mistake; but the hour hand was on it, any way! It's only four,
you can sleep two hours more."
Is not telling a man, "You've only got two hours to sleep," the same thing, on a small scale,
as saying to a criminal, "It's five in the morning, the ceremony will be performed at half-past
seven"? Such sleep is troubled by an idea dressed in grey and furnished with wings, which comes
and flaps, like a bat, upon the windows of your brain.

A woman in a case like this is as exact as a devil coming to claim a soul he has purchased.
When the clock strikes five, your wife's voice, too well known, alas! resounds in your ear;
she accompanies the stroke, and says with an atrocious calmness,
"Adolphe, it's five o'clock, get up, dear."

"Ye-e-e-s, ah-h-h-h!"
"Adolphe, you'll be late for your business, you said so yourself."
"Ah-h-h-h, ye-e-e-e-s." You turn over in despair.

"Come, come, love. I got everything ready last night; now you must, my dear; do you want to
miss him? There, up, I say; it's broad daylight."
Caroline throws off the blankets and gets up: she wants to show you
that _she_ can rise without making a fuss.

She opens the blinds, she lets in the sun, the morning air, the
noise of the street, and then comes back.

"Why, Adolphe, you _must_ get up! Who ever would have supposed you had no energy! But it's
just like you men!

I am only a poor, weak woman, but when I say a thing, I do it."
You get up grumbling, execrating the sacrament of marriage.

There is not the slightest merit in your heroism; it wasn't you, but your wife, that got up. Caroline
gets you everything you want with provoking promptitude; she
foresees everything, she gives you a muffler in winter, a blue-striped
cambric shirt in summer, she treats you like a child; you are still
asleep, she dresses you and has all the trouble.

She finally thrusts you out of doors.

Without her nothing would go straight!

She calls you back to give you a paper, a pocketbook, you had
forgotten.

You don't think of anything, she thinks of everything!

You return five hours afterwards to breakfast, between eleven and noon. The chambermaid is at
the door, or on the stairs, or on the landing, talking with somebody's valet: she runs in on
hearing or seeing you. Your servant is laying the cloth in a most leisurely style, stopping
to look out of the window or to lounge, and coming and going like a person who knows he has
plenty of time. You ask for your wife, supposing that she is up and dressed.

"Madame is still in bed," says the maid.

You find your wife languid, lazy, tired and asleep. She had been awake all night to wake you
in the morning, so she went to bed again, and is quite hungry now.

You are the cause of all these disarrangements. If breakfast is not ready, she says it's
because you went out. If she is not dressed, and if everything is in disorder, it's all your
fault.

For everything which goes awry she has this answer: "Well, you would get up so early!" "He would
get up so early!"

is the universal reason. She makes you go to bed early, because you got up early. She can do
nothing all day, because you would get up so unusually early.

Eighteen months afterwards, she still maintains, "Without me, you
would never get up!"

To her friends she says, "My husband get up!

If it weren't for me, he never _would_ get up!"

To this a man whose hair is beginning to whiten, replies, "A graceful
compliment to you, madame!"

This slightly indelicate comment puts an end to her boasts.

This petty trouble, repeated several times, teaches you to live alone in the bosom of your family,
not to tell all you know, and to have no confidant but yourself:
and it often seems to you a question whether the inconveniences of
the married state do not exceed its advantages.

SMALL VEXATIONS.

You have made a transition from the frolicsome allegretto of the
bachelor to the heavy andante of the father of a family.

Instead of that fine English steed prancing and snorting between the polished shafts of a
tilbury as light as your own heart, and moving his glistening croup under the quadruple
network of the reins and ribbons that you so skillfully manage with what grace and elegance
the Champs Elysees can bear witness--you drive a good solid Norman horse with a steady, family
gait.

You have learned what paternal patience is, and you let no opportunity slip of proving it.
Your countenance, therefore, is serious.

By your side is a domestic, evidently for two purposes like the
carriage.

The vehicle is four-wheeled and hung upon English springs: it is corpulent and resembles a
Rouen scow: it has glass windows, and an infinity of economical arrangements. It is a barouche
in fine weather, and a brougham when it rains. It is apparently light, but, when six persons
are in it, it is heavy and tires out your only horse.

On the back seat, spread out like flowers, is your young wife in full bloom, with her mother, a
big marshmallow with a great many leaves. These two flowers of the female species twitteringly
talk of you, though the noise of the wheels and your attention to the horse, joined to your
fatherly caution, prevent you from hearing what they say.

On the front seat, there is a nice tidy nurse holding a little girl in her lap: by her side
is a boy in a red plaited shirt, who is continually leaning out
of the carriage and climbing upon the cushions, and who has a
thousand times drawn down upon himself those declarations of every
mother, which he knows to be threats and nothing else: "Be a good
boy, Adolphe, or else--" "I declare I'll never bring you again, so
there!"

His mamma is secretly tired to death of this noisy little boy: he has provoked her twenty times,
and twenty times the face of the little girl asleep has calmed her.

"I am his mother," she says to herself. And so she finally manages to keep her little Adolphe quiet.

You have put your triumphant idea of taking your family to ride into execution. You left
your home in the morning, all the opposite neighbors having come to their windows, envying you
the privilege which your means give you of going to the country and coming back again without
undergoing the miseries of a public conveyance. So you have dragged your unfortunate Norman horse
through Paris to Vincennes, from Vincennes to Saint Maur, from Saint Maur to Charenton, from
Charenton opposite some island or other which struck your wife and
mother-in-law as being prettier than all the landscapes through
which you had driven them.

"Let's go to Maison's!" somebody exclaims.

So you go to Maison's, near Alfort.

You come home by the left bank of the Seine, in the midst of a cloud of very black Olympian
dust. The horse drags your family wearily along. But alas!

your pride has fled, and you look without emotion upon his sunken
flanks, and upon two bones which stick out on each side of his belly.

His coat is roughened by the sweat which has repeatedly come out
and dried upon him, and which, no less than the dust, has made him
gummy, sticky and shaggy.

The horse looks like a wrathy porcupine: you are afraid he will be
foundered, and you caress him with the whip-lash in a melancholy
way that he perfectly understands, for he moves his head about like
an omnibus horse, tired of his deplorable existence.

You think a good deal of this horse; your consider him an excellent one and he cost you twelve
hundred francs. When a man has the honor of being the father of a family, he thinks as much of twelve
hundred francs as you think of this horse. You see at once the frightful amount of your extra
expenses, in case Coco should have to lie by. For two days you will have to take hackney
coaches to go to your business.

You wife will pout if she can't go out: but she will go out, and take a carriage. The horse will
cause the purchase of numerous extras, which you will find in your
coachman's bill,--your only coachman, a model coachman, whom you
watch as you do a model anybody.

To these thoughts you give expression in the gentle movement of the whip as it falls upon the
animal's ribs, up to his knees in the black dust which lines the road in front of La Verrerie.

At this moment, little Adolphe, who doesn't know what to do in this
rolling box, has sadly twisted himself up into a corner, and his
grandmother anxiously asks him, "What is the matter?"

"I'm hungry," says the child.

"He's hungry," says the mother to her daughter.

"And why shouldn't he be hungry? It is half-past five, we are not
at the barrier, and we started at two!"

"Your husband might have treated us to dinner in the country."
"He'd rather make his horse go a couple of leagues further, and get back to the house."
"The cook might have had the day to herself.

But Adolphe is right, after all: it's cheaper to dine at home,"
adds the mother-in-law.

"Adolphe," exclaims your wife, stimulated by the word "cheaper,"
"we go so slow that I shall be seasick, and you keep driving right
in this nasty dust.

What are you thinking of?

My gown and hat will be ruined!"

"Would you rather ruin the horse?"

you ask, with the air of a man who can't be answered.

"Oh, no matter for your horse; just think of your son who is dying
of hunger: he hasn't tasted a thing for seven hours.

Whip up your old horse!

One would really think you cared more for your nag than for your
child!"

You dare not give your horse a single crack with the whip, for he
might still have vigor enough left to break into a gallop and run
away.

"No, Adolphe tries to vex me, he's going slower," says the young
wife to her mother.

"My dear, go as slow as you like.

But I know you'll say I am extravagant when you see me buying another
hat."

Upon this you utter a series of remarks which are lost in the racket made by the wheels.

"What's the use of replying with reasons that haven't got an ounce
of common-sense?" cries Caroline.

You talk, turning your face to the carriage and then turning back to the horse, to avoid an
accident.

"That's right, run against somebody and tip us over, do, you'll be rid of us. Adolphe, your
son is dying of hunger. See how pale he is!"
"But Caroline," puts in the mother-in-law, "he's doing the best he can."
Nothing annoys you so much as to have your mother-in-law take your part. She is a hypocrite and
is delighted to see you quarreling with her daughter. Gently and with infinite precaution she
throws oil on the fire.

When you arrive at the barrier, your wife is mute. She says not a
word, she sits with her arms crossed, and will not look at you.

You have neither soul, heart, nor sentiment. No one but you could have invented such a party
of pleasure. If you are unfortunate enough to remind Caroline that it was she who insisted on
the excursion, that morning, for her children's sake, and in behalf of her milk--she nurses
the baby--you will be overwhelmed by an avalanche of frigid and stinging reproaches.

You bear it all so as "not to turn the milk of a nursing mother, for whose sake you must overlook
some little things," so your atrocious mother-in-law whispers in your ear.

All the furies of Orestes are rankling in your heart.

In reply to the sacramental words pronounced by the officer of the customs, "Have you anything
to declare?" your wife says, "I declare a great deal of ill-humor
and dust."

She laughs, the officer laughs, and you feel a desire to tip your
family into the Seine.

Unluckily for you, you suddenly remember the joyous and perverse young woman who wore a pink bonnet
and who made merry in your tilbury six years before, as you passed this spot on your way to
the chop-house on the river's bank. What a reminiscence! Was Madame Schontz anxious about
babies, about her bonnet, the lace of which was torn to pieces in the bushes? No, she had
no care for anything whatever, not even for her dignity, for she shocked the rustic police
of Vincennes by the somewhat daring freedom of her style of
dancing.

  You return home, you have frantically hurried your Norman horse, and
  have neither prevented an indisposition of the animal, nor an indisposition
  of your wife.
  
  That evening, Caroline has very little milk. If the baby cries and
  if your head is split in consequence, it is all your fault, as
  you preferred the health of your horse to that of your son who was
  dying of hunger, and of your daughter whose supper has disappeared
  in a discussion in which your wife was right, _as she always
  is_.
  
  "Well, well," she says, "men are not mothers!"
  As you leave the chamber, you hear your mother-in-law consoling her
  daughter by these terrible words: "Come, be calm, Caroline: that's
  the way with them all: they are a selfish lot: your father was just
  like that!"
  THE ULTIMATUM.
  
  It is eight o'clock; you make your appearance in the bedroom of your
  wife. There is a brilliant light. The chambermaid and the cook hover
  lightly about. The furniture is covered with dresses and flowers
  tried on and laid aside.
  
  The hair-dresser is there, an artist par excellence, a sovereign
authority, at once nobody and everything. You hear the other domestics
going and coming: orders are given and recalled, errands are well
or ill performed. The disorder is at its height. This chamber is a
studio from whence to issue a parlor Venus.
Your wife desires to be the fairest at the ball which you are to
attend. Is it still for your sake, or only for herself, or is it
for somebody else? Serious questions these.
The idea does not even occur to you.
You are squeezed, hampered, harnessed in your ball accoutrement:
you count your steps as you walk, you look around, you observe, you
contemplate talking business on neutral ground with a stock-broker,
a notary or a banker, to whom you would not like to give an advantage
over you by calling at their house.
A singular fact which all have probably observed, but the causes
of which can hardly be determined, is the peculiar repugnance which
men dressed and ready to go to a party have for discussions or to
answer questions. At the moment of starting, there are few husbands
who are not taciturn and profoundly absorbed in reflections which
vary with their characters. Those who reply give curt and peremptory
answers.
But women, at this time, are exceedingly aggravating. They consult
you, they ask your advice upon the best way of concealing the stem
of a rose, of giving a graceful fall to a bunch of briar, or a happy
turn to a scarf. As a neat English expression has it, "they fish
for compliments," and sometimes for better than compliments.
A boy just out of school would discern the motive concealed behind
the willows of these pretexts:
but your wife is so well known to you, and you have so often playfully
joked upon her moral and physical perfections, that you are harsh
enough to give your opinion briefly and conscientiously:
you thus force Caroline to put that decisive question, so cruel to
women, even those who have been married twenty years:
"So I don't suit you then?"
Drawn upon the true ground by this inquiry, you bestow upon her
such little compliments as you can spare and which are, as it were,
the small change, the sous, the liards of your purse.
"The best gown you ever wore!" "I never saw you so well dressed."
"Blue, pink, yellow, cherry [take your pick], becomes you charmingly."
"Your head-dress is quite original." "As you go in, every one will
admire you." "You will not only be the prettiest, but the best
dressed." "They'll all be mad not to have your taste." "Beauty is
a natural gift: taste is like intelligence, a thing that we may be
proud of." 
"Do you think so? Are you in earnest, Adolphe?"
Your wife is coquetting with you. She chooses this moment to force
from you your pretended opinion of one and another of her friends,
and to insinuate the price of the articles of her dress you so much
admire. Nothing is too dear to please you. She sends the cook out
of the room.

"Let's go," you say.
She sends the chambermaid out after having dismissed the hair-dresser,
and begins to turn round and round before her glass, showing off
to you her most glorious beauties.

"Let's go," you say.
"You are in a hurry," she returns.
And she goes on exhibiting herself with all her little airs, setting
herself off like a fine peach magnificently exhibited in a fruiterer's
window. But since you have dined rather heartily, you kiss her upon
the forehead merely, not feeling able to countersign your opinions.
Caroline becomes serious.
The carriage waits. All the household looks at Caroline as she goes
out: she is the masterpiece to which all have contributed, and
everybody admires the common work.
Your wife departs highly satisfied with herself, but a good deal
displeased with you. She proceeds loftily to the ball, just as a
picture, caressed by the painter and minutely retouched in the
studio, is sent to the annual exhibition in the vast bazaar of the
Louvre. Your wife, alas!
sees fifty women handsomer than herself: they have invented dresses
of the most extravagant price, and more or less original: and that
which happens at the Louvre to the masterpiece, happens to the
object of feminine labor: your wife's dress seems pale by the side
of another very much like it, but the livelier color of which crushes
it.["So that's
  what mother was hinting at," thought Eileen, with a smile.] It was all
  I could do not to cable to you: 'Will you marry me? Reply paid.' ["What
  a good idea for a song!" murmured Nelly.] Put me out of my agony as
  soon as you can, won't you, dearest Eileen? Your face is floating
  before me as I write, with its black Irish eyes and its roguish
  dimples...."

She could read no more. She sat long on her bed, dazed by the rush of bitter-sweet memories.
The Convent, her father, her early years, this dear boy ... all was washed together in tears.
There was something so bizarre, unexpected and ingenuous about it all; it touched the elemental
in her. Kasim Ali had received orders to the same effect from Mr. Scrafton, who informed him
he was sending an officer to accept their surrender. This did not however prevent Kasim Ali
from trying to get hold of them, which accounts for the following letter from Raja Ram Nath
to Clive:[155]--
"The French are now coming from another country by boats to go towards Muxadavad, and Kasim
Ali Khan's people have followed them, out of his own country into mine. They have left their boats
among Kasim Ali Khan's people and are now travelling to Jangepors" (? Tangepur).

them, and I now hear that they have surrounded them.

precipitates the avalanche or decides a revolution?
