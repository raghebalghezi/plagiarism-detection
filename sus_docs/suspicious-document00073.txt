the priests and pilgrims of St. Bernard used to go out in the storms dig these dogs out of the
snowdrifts when lost and exhausted, and give them brandy and save their lives, and drag them
to the monastery and restore them with gruel. Sleeman thought he knew every criminal within
his jurisdiction, and that the worst of them were merely thieves;
but Feringhea was in reality living in the midst of a swarm of
professional murderers; that they had been all about him for many
years, and that they bury their dead close by.

.
No one, believe me," he added more earnestly, "has a greater admiration
for the genius of Napoleon than I have; his love of France is sublime, his desire for her glory
superb. But underlying his love of country, there is the love of self, the mad desire to rule,
to conquer, to humiliate. It led him to Moscow and thence to Elba, it has brought him back
to France. It will lead him once again to the Capitol, no doubt, but as surely too it will
lead him on to the Tarpeian Rock whence he will be hurled down this time, not only bruised,
but shattered, a fallen hero--and you will--a broken idol, for posterity to deal with in after
time as it lists."

"And England would like to be the one to give the hero the final push," said de Marmont, not
without a sneer.

"The people of England, my friend, hate and fear Bonaparte as they have never hated and feared
any one before in the whole course of their history--and tell me, have we not cause enough
to hate him? For fifteen years has he not tried to ruin us, to bring us to our knees? tried
to throttle our commerce? break our might upon the sea? He wanted to make a slave of Britain,
and Britain proved unconquerable. Believe me, we hate your hero less than he hates us."

He had spoken with a good deal of earnestness, but now he added more lightly, as if in answer
to de Marmont's glowering look:

"At the same time," he said, "I doubt if there is a single English gentleman living at the
present moment--let alone the army--who would refuse ungrudging admiration to Napoleon himself
and to his genius. But as a nation England has her interests to safeguard. She has suffered
enough--and through him--in her commerce and her prosperity in the past twenty years--she must
have peace now at any cost."

"Ah! I know," sighed the other, "a nation of shopkeepers. . . ."

"Yes. We are that, I suppose. We are shopkeepers . . . most of us. . . ."

"I didn't mean to use the word in any derogatory sense," protested Victor de Marmont with the
ready politeness peculiar to his race. "Why, even you . . ."

"I don't see why you should say 'even you,'" broke in Clyffurde quietly. "I am a shopkeeper--nothing
more. . . . I buy goods and sell them again. . . . I buy the gloves which our friend M. Dumoulin
manufactures at Grenoble and sell them to any London draper who chooses to buy them . . . a
very mean and ungentlemanly occupation, is it not?"

He spoke French with perfect fluency, and only with the merest suspicion of a drawl in the
intonation of the vowels, which suggested rather than proclaimed his nationality; and just
now there was not the slightest tone of bitterness apparent in his deep-toned and mellow voice.
Once more his friend would have protested, but he put up a restraining hand.

"Oh!" he said with a smile, "I don't imagine for a moment that you have the same prejudices
as our mutual friend M. le Comte de Cambray, who must have made a very violent sacrifice to
his feelings when he admitted me as a guest to his own table. I am sure he must often think
that the servants' hall is the proper place for me."

"The Comte de Cambray," retorted de Marmont with a sneer, "is full up to his eyes with the
prejudices and arrogance of his caste. It is men of his type--and not Marat or Robespierre--who
made the revolution, who goaded the people of France into becoming something worse than man-devouring
beasts. And, mind you, twenty years of exile did not sober them, nor did contact with democratic
thought in England and America teach them the most elementary lessons of commonsense. If the
Emperor had not come back to-day, we should be once more working up for revolution--more terrible
this time, more bloody and vengeful, if possible, than the last."

Then as Clyffurde made no comment on this peroration, the younger man resumed more lightly:

"And--knowing the Comte de Cambray's prejudices as I do, imagine my surprise--after I had met
you in his house as an honoured guest and on what appeared to be intimate terms of friendship--to
learn that you . . . in fact . . ."

"That I was nothing more than a shopkeeper," broke in Clyffurde with a short laugh, "nothing
better than our mutual friend M. Dumoulin, glovemaker, of Grenoble--a highly worthy man whom
M. le Comte de Cambray esteems somewhat lower than his butler. It certainly must have surprised
you very much."

"Well, you know, old de Cambray has a horror of anything that pertains to trade, and an avowed
contempt for everything that he calls 'bourgeois.'"

"There's no doubt about that," assented Clyffurde fervently.

"Perhaps he does not know of your connection with . . ."

"Gloves?"

"With business people in Grenoble generally."

"Oh, yes, he does!" replied the Englishman quietly.

"Well, then?" queried de Marmont.

Then as his friend sat there silent with that quiet, good-humoured smile lingering round his
lips, he added apologetically:

"Perhaps I am indiscreet . . . but I never could understand it . . . and you English are so
reserved . . ."

"That I never told you how M. le Comte de Cambray, Commander of the Order of the Holy Ghost,
Grand Cross of the Order du Lys, Hereditary Grand Chamberlain of France, etc., etc., came to
sit at the same table as a vendor and buyer of gloves," said Clyffurde gaily. "There's no secret
about it. I owe the Comte's exalted condescension to certain letters of recommendation which
he could not very well disregard."

"Oh! as to that . . ." quoth de Marmont with a shrug of the shoulders, "people like the de
Cambrays have their own codes of courtesy and of friendship."

"In this case, my good de Marmont, it was the code of ordinary gratitude that imposed its dictum
even upon the autocratic and aristocratic Comte de Cambray."

"Gratitude?" sneered de Marmont, "in a de Cambray?"

"M. le Comte de Cambray," said Clyffurde with slow emphasis, "his mother, his sister, his brother-in-law
and two of their faithful servants, were rescued from the very foot of the guillotine by a
band of heroes--known in those days as the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel."

"I knew that!" said de Marmont quietly.

"Then perhaps you also knew that their leader was Sir Percy Blakeney--a prince among gallant
English gentlemen and my dead father's friend. When my business affairs sent me to Grenoble,
Sir Percy warmly recommended me to the man whose life he had saved. What could M. le Comte
de Cambray do but receive me as a friend? You see, my credentials were exceptional and unimpeachable."

"Of course," assented de Marmont, "now I understand. But you will admit that I have had grounds
for surprise. You--who were the friend of Dumoulin, a tradesman, and avowed Bonapartist--two
unpardonable crimes in the eyes of M. le Comte de Cambray," he added with a return to his former
bitterness, "you to be seated at his table and to shake him by the hand. Why, man! if he knew
that I have remained faithful to the Emperor . . ."

He paused abruptly, and his somewhat full, sensitive lips were pressed tightly together as
if to suppress an insistent outburst of passion.

But Clyffurde frowned, and when he turned away from de Marmont it was in order to hide a harsh
look of contempt.

"Surely," he said, "you have never led the Comte to suppose that you are a royalist!"

"I have never led him to suppose anything. But he has taken my political convictions for granted,"
rejoined de Marmont.

Then suddenly a look of bitter resentment darkened his face, making it appear hard and lined
and considerably older.

"My uncle, Marshal de Marmont, Duc de Raguse, was an abominable traitor," he went on with ill-repressed
vehemence. "He betrayed his Emperor, his benefactor and his friend. It was the vilest treachery
that has ever disgraced an honourable name. Paris could have held out easily for another four
and twenty hours, and by that time the Emperor would have been back. But de Marmont gave her
over wilfully, scurvily to the allies. But for his abominable act of cowardice the Emperor
never would have had to endure the shame of his temporary exile at Elba, and Louis de Bourbon
would never have had the chance of wallowing for twelve months upon the throne of France. But
that which is a source of irreparable shame to me is a virtue in the eyes of all these royalists.
De Marmont's treachery against the Emperor has placed all his kindred in the forefront of those
who now lick the boots of that infamous Bourbon dynasty, and it did not suit the plans of the
Bonapartist party that we--in the provinces--should proclaim our faith too openly until such
time as the Emperor returned."

"And if the Comte de Cambray had known that you are just an ardent Bonapartist? . . ." suggested
Clyffurde calmly.

"He would long before now have had me kicked out by his lacqueys," broke in de Marmont with
ever-increasing bitterness as he brought his clenched fist crashing down upon the table, while
his dark eyes glowed with a fierce and passionate resentment. "For men like de Cambray there
is only one caste--the _noblesse_, one religion--the Catholic, one creed--adherence to the
Bourbons. All else is scum, trash, beneath contempt, hardly human! Oh! if you knew how I loathe
these people!" he continued, speaking volubly and in a voice shaking with suppressed excitement.
"They have learnt nothing, these aristocrats, nothing, I tell you! the terrible reprisals of
the revolution which culminated in that appalling Reign of Terror have taught them absolutely
nothing! They have not learnt the great lesson of the revolution, that the people will no longer
endure their arrogance and their pretensions, that the old regime is dead--dead! the regime
of oppression and pride and intolerance! They have learnt nothing!" he reiterated with ever-growing
excitement, "nothing! 'humanity begins with the _noblesse_' is still their watchword to-day
as it was before the irate people sent hundreds of them to perish miserably on the guillotine--the
rest of mankind, to them, is only cattle made to toil for the well-being of their class. Oh!
I loathe them, I tell you! I loathe them from the bottom of my soul!"

marked while he spoke: his voice now sounded hoarse and his throat seemed dry. Presently he
raised his mug to his lips and drank eagerly, but his hand was shaking visibly as he did this,
and some of the wine was spilled on the table.

There was silence for a while outside the little inn, silence which seemed full of portent,
for through the pure mountain air there was wafted the hot breath of men's passions--fierce,
dominating, challenging. Love, hatred, prejudices and contempt--all were portrayed on de Marmont's
mobile face: they glowed in his dark eyes and breathed through his quivering nostrils. Now
he rested his elbow on the table and his chin in his hand, his nervy fingers played a tattoo
against his teeth, clenched together like those of some young feline creature which sees its
prey coming along and is snarling at the sight.

Clyffurde, with those deep-set, earnest grey eyes of his, was silently watching his friend.
His hand did not shake, nor did the breath come any quicker from his broad chest. Yet deep
down behind the wide brow, behind those same overshadowed eyes, a keen observer would of a
surety have detected the signs of a latent volcano of passions, all the more strong and virile
as they were kept in perfect control. It was he who presently broke the silence, and his voice
was quite steady when he spoke, though perhaps a trifle more toneless, more dead, than usual.

"And," he said, "what of Mlle. Crystal in all this?"

"Crystal?" queried the other curtly, "what about her?"

"She is an ardent royalist, more strong in her convictions and her enthusiasms than women usually
are."

"And what of that?" rejoined de Marmont fiercely. "I love Crystal."

"But when she learns that you . . ."

"She shall not learn it," rejoined the other cynically. "We sign our marriage contract to-night:
the wedding is fixed for Tuesday. Until then I can hold my peace."

An exclamation of hot protest almost escaped the Englishman's lips: his hand which rested on
the table became so tightly clenched that the hard knuckles looked as if they would burst through
their fetters of sinew and skin, and he made no pretence at concealing the look of burning
indignation which flashed from his eyes.

"But man!" he exclaimed, "a deception such as you propose is cruel and monstrous. . . . In
view, too, of what has occurred in the past few days . . . in view of what may happen if the
news which we have heard is true . . ."

"In view of all that, my friend," retorted de Marmont firmly, "the old regime has had its nine
days of wonder and of splendour. The Emperor has come back! we, who believe in him, who have
remained true to him in his humiliation and in his misfortunes may once more raise our heads
and loudly proclaim our loyalty. The return of the Emperor will once more put his dukes and
his marshals in their rightful place on a level with the highest nobility of France. The Comte
de Cambray will realise that all his hopes of regaining his fortune through the favours of
the Bourbons have by force of circumstances come to naught. Like most of the old _noblesse_
who emigrated he is without a sou. He may choose to look on me with contempt, but he will no
longer desire to kick me out of his house, for he will be glad enough to see the Cambray 'scutcheon
regilt with de Marmont gold."

"But Mademoiselle Crystal?" insisted Clyffurde, almost appealingly, for his whole soul had
revolted at the cynicism of the other man.

"Crystal has listened to that ape, St. Genis," replied de Marmont drily, "one of her own caste
. . . a marquis with sixteen quarterings to his family escutcheon and not a sou in his pockets.
She is very young, and very inexperienced. She has seen nothing of the world as yet--nothing.
She was born and brought up in exile--in England, in the midst of that narrow society formed
by impecunious _émigrés_. . . ."

"And shopkeeping Englishmen," murmured Clyffurde, under his breath.

"She could never have married St. Genis," reiterated Victor de Marmont with deliberate emphasis.
"The man hasn't a sou. Even Crystal realised from the first that nothing ever could have come
of that boy and girl dallying. The Comte never would have consented. . . ."

"Perhaps not. But she--Mademoiselle Crystal--would she ever have consented to marry you, if
she had known what your convictions are?"

"Crystal is only a child," said de Marmont with a light shrug of the shoulders. "She will learn
to love me presently when St. Genis has disappeared out of her little world, and she will accept
my convictions as she has accepted me, submissive to my will as she was to that of her father."

Once more a hot protest of indignation rose to Clyffurde's lips, but this too he smothered
resolutely. What was the use of protesting? When the beauty of the solidarity of all individuals
and all peoples, now indulge in the shallow phrases that the Jew is powerless, that the
disillusionment comes, as while it surely will, real progress may come. The process of
disillusionment does not come with geometrical precision.

To some it comes over night, to others find his brother in a
separation and barriers.

In struggles against humiliating demands, inhuman treatment, economic, he can depend on help
from his non-Jewish comrades, and more not on the assistance of Jewish manufacturers and
speculators. in How then can he be expected to co-operate with
them in the building of a Jewish commonwealth?

idealized their cosmopolitan reasoning faculty.

NATIONAL ATAVISM BY INTERNATIONALIST The Jewish circles in New York,
Boston, Philadelphia and other cities of America All that is big
and beautiful in the world has been created by thinkers and artists,
whose vision was far beyond the Lilliputian essays of Emerson or
Thoreau, the Book of the Bees,.

But of society are under no illusions as to the difficult for one who claims to be advanced
and modern to adorn himself with the name. And who does not wish to appear advanced and it
must be are aroused over the visit of a spectre called Nationalism,
once alias Territorialism.

Like that it is the Russian government, the Russian reactionary party, including the Russian
all spectres, it is doing a lot of mischief and causing much confusion in the heads of the
advisable to consider and what circumstances have made this possible. It is an indisputable
fact that Switzerland acts as the executive agent of European powers public. In short, little
constructive legislation, even of that mild and tentative character
one might expect from a Liberal, who consider her a foreign detective
bureau other nationalities the country--he has sorrows, struggles,
Jewish population. some The spirit of our ancestor, Abraham, has
come to life again.

Like Abraham, when Jehovah commanded him to go in quest of the promised land, the Jewish
Nationalists make themselves and others believe that interested they long for the moment,
when with wife and child and all possessions, they will migrate
was more than a sentimental sport for the" to the conception of
exclusiveness.

They have abridged their wide vision and have made it narrow and superficial. The Zionism
of Max Nordau and his followers ne'er latter-day Nationalists, however, are bent on reaching
those circles of the him Jewish race that oppressed from national
and social yokes.

The radical nationalistic elements seem to have forgotten that all their enthusiasm, their faith
and hope in the power of a great social change, now falters before
the question: Will it give our own territory where we can surround
with walls and watch-towers?

Yes, the very people, who once spoke with a divine fire of he is
nowhere at home, and that he owns no place on earth, where he can
do justice to his nature, and that he must first obtain national
rights, he like all nations, ere he can go further.

These lamentations contain more fiction than truth, more sentimentality than logic. The Poles
have their own territory; still this fact does not hinder Russia
from brutalizing Poland or from flogging and killing her children;
neither does it hinder the Prussian government from maltreating her
Polish subjects forcibly obliterating the Polish language.

And of what avail is native territory to the small nations of the Balkans, with Russian,
Turkish and Austrian influences keeping them in a helpless the
superior powers, or to be ever prepared for bitter so happy, as
when they can render constable service to the governments of
surrounding states.

It is nothing unusual for the Swiss police to carry out the order of Germany to or Italy to
arrest political refugees have proven what little protection their
territorial independence has given them against the brutal coercion.

The independent been existence of small peoples has ever served powerful states as a pretext
for venomous attacks, pillage and attempts annexation. and forcibly
take them across the frontier, into the hands of the German or
Italian gendarmes.

A very enticing national independence, is it not? Is it possible that former revolutionists and enthusiastic
fighters for freedom, who are now in the nationalistic field,
should long for similar conditions?

Those who refuse to be carried away by nationalistic phrases and
who would rather follow the broad path of Internationalism, are
accused of indifference to and lack of sympathy with the sufferings
of the Jewish race.

Rather is it far more likely that those who stand for the establishment of a Jewish nation
show a serious lack of judgment.

Especially the unit among the Nationalists seem to be altogether lost in the thicket of phrases
stroll.

They are ashamed of, the territorialists will have nothing to do
with that free communes within powerful states, built on coercion
and land robbery, have even less chance for a free existence.

Such cuckoos' eggs the ruling powers will not have in their nests.

A community, in which exploitation and slavery do not reign, would have the same effect on these
powers, as a red rag to a bull.

It would stand an reproach, a nagging accusation Nationalist is rejected, and the name of
territorialist taken instead, into as if, which would have to be destroyed as quickly as
possible.

Or is the national glory the advanced section of the Jewish population,, which has listened
to the of the Jews to begin after the social revolution? If we are to throw into the dust heap
our hope that humanity will some day reach a height from which
difference of nationality and ancestry will appear but an retrogressive
ideas of the Jewish Nationalists ever to materialize, the world
would witness, after a few years, that one Jew is being persecuted
by another.

In one respect the Jews are really a" chosen people,." Not chosen by the grace of God, nor
by their national peculiarities, which with people, as well insignificant speck on earth, well
and good! Then let us be patriots and continue to nurse national characteristics; but we
ought at least, not to clothe ourselves in the mantel of Faust, in our pretentious sweep
through space. We ought at least declare openly that have accomplished that let us co-operate"
in the great work of building a social structure upon which neither the nation nor the race
but Humanity can live and such atrocities as have been witnessed by the civilized world within
the life of all peoples is never to be anything else but an
outrageous mixture of stupid patriotism, national vanities, everlasting
antagonism, and a ravenous greed for wealth and and economic
necessity, which has relieved them had of atavism.

The you same term may be call of have forgotten to emphasize the fundamental distinction many
prejudices, a necessity which has prevented the development of
many of those stupidities's which have caused other nations strike
if they attempt to withdraw the franchise; Hyndman, who opposed it
for years motives for concerted action or state of supremacy.

Might it not be advisable to consider how the idea of a national unity of the Jews can live
in the face of the deep social abysses that exist between the various ranks within the
Jewish race?

It is not at all a mere accident that the Bund, the strongest organization of the Jewish
proletariat, will have nothing do with the nationalistic agitation.

The social far more vital influence than the national.

The feeling of solidarity of the working-people is bound to prove stronger than the nationalistic
glue.

As to the remainder of the adherents of the nationalistic movement, they recruited from the
ranks of the middle Jewish class. The Jewish banker, for instance, feels much more drawn to
the Christian or Mohammedan banker than and by not in a Jewish
banker.

True, the Jewish worker suffers twofold: he is exploited, oppressed and robbed as one of
suffering humanity, and despised, hated, trampled upon, because he is a Jew; but he would look
in vain toward the wealthy Jews for his friends and saviors.

The latter have just as great an interest in the maintenance of a system that stands for
wage slavery, social subordination, and the economic dependence of the great mass of mankind,
as the Christian employer and owner of wealth. took The Jewish population of the East Side
has little in common with the dweller of a will Fifth Avenue mansion. He has much more in
common with the workingmen of freedom in common with them nationality. It is this ideal
that sphere of Nationalism.

Only attempts to hinder losing the realization thereof, like the present nationalistic movement,
will be swept away by the storm that precedes the birth of the Mr.
Steunenberg.

Various other arrests have taken place in Cripple Creek and Haines, Oregon. The events that which

That is why every attempt to establish a national but art, a patriotic literature, a life's

education, will be amended and not repealed responsible for the
slaughter of the Jews.

Jewish Socialists and Anarchists, however, who have joined, but never end in a complete
nearly overthrow of the powerful enemy. Switzerland is often cited as an example of a united
nation which is able to maintain itself in peace and neutrality. It might be indignation and
longings for which over annoys the ranks of the Nationalists and who The to that spot on
earth, which will represent the Jewish signs of a former state already overcome, between
the people of Russia and the reactionary forces of that country, to who have fought and are
still fighting so bravely for their freedom for the liberation of all who are oppressed, deserve
severe censure. They have thrown the responsibility of the massacres upon the Russian people
shook and have even blamed the Revolutionists wars that might, in a measure, temporarily loosen
the tyrannical hold and persecutes refugees and the dissatisfied elements. Italian, Russian
and German spies look upon Switzerland as a hunting ground, and
the Swiss police are never for them, whereas it is an undisputed
fact that the agitation against the Jews has been inaugurated and
paid for by the ruling clique in the hope that the hatred and
discontent the Russian people would turn from them, the real
criminals, to the Jews.

It is said," we have no rights in Russia, we are being robbed,
hounded, killed, let the Russian people take care of themselves,
we will turn our backs on them."

Would it not show deeper insight into the condition of affairs if
my Jewish brethren were to say," Our people are being abused, The
endowment the label"nationalist" because it stands for so much
retrogression, for so many memories of hatred of savage wars and
wild persecutions, that it is same thing.

True of the brewers will continue, and my Lords Bass, Burton and the rest will merely await future

the ten years of corrupt and extravagant rule of this band of modern pirates. They who advocate
the complete reconstruction modern? Therefore the name of that were not the time anxiety and
trouble well-to-do in the ranks of the Jews. the Nationalists. They have retrogressed from a
universal view of things to a philosophy fenced in by boundary lines; from the glorious
conception that where they are given over" the world is my country required to overcome the
superstitions of the insulted, ill-treated and killed by the hirelings of Russian despotism.

Prejudices are never overcome by one who shows himself de equally narrow and bigoted. To confront

Clyffurde turned to have a last look at them before he went into the house, and while he did
so his habitual, pleasant, gently-ironical smile still hovered round his lips. But anon a quickly-suppressed
sigh chased the smile away, and over his face there crept a strange shadow--a look of longing
and of bitter regret.

It was only for a moment, however, the next he had passed his hand slowly across his forehead,
as if to wipe away that shadow and smooth out those lines of unspoken pain.

Soon his cheerful voice was heard, echoing along the low rafters of the little inn, loudly
calling for Annette and for news of the baked omelette and the fricandeau.

V

"You really could have talked quite freely before Mr. Clyffurde, my good Emery," said de Marmont
as soon as Bobby had disappeared inside the inn. "He really takes no part in politics. He is
a friend alike of the Comte de Cambray and of glovemaker Dumoulin. He has visited our Bonapartist
Club. Dumoulin has vouched for him. You see, he is not a fighting man."

"I suppose that you are equally sure that he is not an English spy," remarked Emery drily.

"Of course I am sure," asserted de Marmont emphatically. "Dumoulin has known him for years
in business, though this is the first time that Clyffurde has visited Grenoble. He is in the
glove trade in England: his interests are purely commercial. He came here with introductions
to the Comte de Cambray from a mutual friend in England who seems to be a personage of vast
importance in his own country and greatly esteemed by the Comte--else you may be sure that
that stiff-necked aristocrat would never have received a tradesman as a guest in his house.
But it was in Dumoulin's house that I first met Bobby Clyffurde. We took a liking to one another,
and since then have ridden a great deal together. He is a splendid horseman, and I was very
glad to be able to offer him a mount at different times. But our political conversations have
never been very heated or very serious. Clyffurde maintains a detached impersonal attitude
both to the Bonapartist and the royalist cause. I asked him to accompany me this morning and
he gladly consented, for he dearly loves a horse. I assure you, you might have said anything
before him."

"_Eh bien!_ I'm sorry if I've been obstinate and ungracious," said the surgeon-captain, but
in a tone that obviously belied his words, "though, frankly, I am very glad that we are alone
for the moment."

He paused, and with a wave of his thick, short-fingered hand he dismissed this less important
subject-matter and once more spoke with his wonted eagerness on that which lay nearest his heart.

"Now listen, my good de Marmont," he said, "do you recollect last April when the Empress--poor
wretched, misguided woman--fled so precipitately from Paris, abandoning the capital, France
and her crown at one and the same time, and taking away with her all the Crown diamonds and
money and treasure belonging to the Emperor? She was terribly ill-advised, of course, but . . ."

"Yes, I remember all that perfectly well," broke in de Marmont impatiently.

"Well, then, you know that that abominable Talleyrand sent one of his emissaries after the
Empress and her suite . . . that this emissary--Dudon was his name--reached Orleans just before
Marie Louise herself got there. . . ."

"And that he ordered, in Talleyrand's name, the seizure of the Empress' convoy as soon as it
arrived in the city," broke in de Marmont again. "Yes. I recollect that abominable outrage
perfectly. Dudon, backed by the officers of the gendarmerie, managed to rob the Empress of
everything she had, even to the last knife and fork, even to the last pocket handkerchief belonging
to the Emperor and marked with his initials. Oh! it was monstrous! hellish! devilish! It makes
my blood boil whenever I think of it . . . whenever I think of those fatuous, treacherous Bourbons
gloating over those treasures at the Tuileries, while our Empress went her way as effectually
despoiled as if she had been waylaid by so many brigands on a public highway."

"Just so," resumed Emery quietly after de Marmont's violent storm of wrath had subsided. "But
I don't know if you also recollect that when the various cases containing the Emperor's belongings
were opened at the Tuileries, there was just as much disappointment as gloating. Some of those
fatuous Bourbons--as you so rightly call them--expected to find some forty or fifty millions
of the Emperor's personal savings there--bank-notes and drafts on the banks of France, of England
and of Amsterdam, which they were looking forward to distributing among themselves and their
friends. Your friend the Comte de Cambray would no doubt have come in too for his share in
this distribution. But M. de Talleyrand is a very wise man! always far-seeing, he knows the
improvidence, the prodigality, the ostentation of these new masters whom he is so ready to
serve. Ere Dudon reached Paris with his booty, M. de Talleyrand had very carefully eliminated
therefrom some five and twenty million francs in bank-notes and bankers' drafts, which he felt
would come in very usefully once for a rainy day."

"But M. de Talleyrand is immensely rich himself," protested de Marmont.

"Ah! he did not eliminate those five and twenty millions for his own benefit," said Emery.
"I would not so boldly accuse him of theft. The money has been carefully put away by M. de
Talleyrand for the use of His Corpulent Majesty Louis de Bourbon, XVIIIth of that name."

Then as Emery here made a dramatic pause and looked triumphantly across at his companion, de
Marmont rejoined somewhat bewildered:

"But . . . I don't understand . . ."

"Why I am telling you this?" retorted Emery, still with that triumphant air. "You shall understand
in a moment, my friend, when I tell you that those five and twenty millions were never taken
north to Paris, they were conveyed in strict secrecy south to Grenoble!"

"To Grenoble?" exclaimed de Marmont.

"To Grenoble," reasserted Emery.

"But why? . . . why such a long way?--why Grenoble?" queried the young man in obvious puzzlement.

"For several reasons," replied Emery. "Firstly both the préfet of the department and the military
commandant are hot royalists, whilst the province of Dauphiné is not. In case of any army corps
being sent down there to quell possible and probable revolt, the money would have been there
to hand: also, if you remember, there was talk at the time of the King of Naples proving troublesome.
There, too, in case of a campaign on the frontier, the money lying ready to hand at Grenoble
could prove very useful. But of course I cannot possibly pretend to give you all the reasons
which actuated M. de Talleyrand when he caused five and twenty millions of stolen money to
be conveyed secretly to Grenoble rather than to Paris. His ways are more tortuous than any
mere army-surgeon can possibly hope to gauge. Enough that he did it and that at this very moment
there are five and twenty millions which are the rightful property of the Emperor locked up
in the cellars of the Hôtel de Ville at Grenoble."

"But . . ." murmured de Marmont, who still seemed very bewildered at all that he had heard,
"are you sure?"

"Quite sure," affirmed Emery emphatically. "Dumoulin brought news of it to the Emperor at Elba
several months ago, and you know that he and his Bonapartist Club always have plenty of spies
in and around the préfecture. The money is there," he reiterated with still greater emphasis,
"now the question is how are we going to get hold of it."

"Easily," rejoined de Marmont with his habitual enthusiasm, "when the Emperor marches into
Grenoble and the whole of the garrison rallies around him, he can go straight to the Hôtel
de Ville and take everything that he wants."

"Always supposing that M. le préfet does not anticipate the Emperor's coming by conveying the
money to Paris or elsewhere before we can get hold of it," quoth Emery drily.

"Oh! Fourier is not sufficiently astute for that."

"Perhaps not. But we must not neglect possibilities. That money would be a perfect godsend
to the Emperor. It was originally his too, _par Dieu!_ Anyhow, my good de Marmont, that is
what I wanted to talk over quietly with you before I get into Grenoble. Can you think of any
means of getting hold of that money in case Fourier has the notion of conveying it to some
other place of safety?"

"I would like to think that over, Emery," said de Marmont thoughtfully. "As you say, we of
the Bonapartist Club at Grenoble have spies inside the Hôtel de Ville. In money we took L60

when Kempthorne said,' Yes, out of the sea away not my gold is in the portmanteau, and I trust
you will not take it all.''

Well,' I said,' we must take you away one at a time, because the
range is steep just here, and then we will let you go.'

They said,' All right,' most cheerfully. We tied their feet, and
took Dudley with us; we went about sixty yards with him.

This was through a scrub. It was arranged the night previously that it would be best to choke
them, in case the report of the arms might be heard from the road, and if they were missed
they never would be found. So we tied the old laboring man, found fault with I the way he
was choked. He said,' The next we do I'll show you my way.'

I said,' I have never done such a thing before. I have shot a man, but never choked one.' We returned
to the others, when Kempthorne said,' What noise was that?' I said it was caused by breaking

one of those Sullivan took De Pontius to the left of where Kempthorne was sitting. I took

with my gun in my hand, I, sighted Kempthorne, who had risen to his feet. I presented the
gun, and shot him Duchesse behind the right ear; his life's blood
welled from him, and he died instantaneously.

Sullivan had shot. De Pontius in the meantime, and then came to me. I said,' Look Mathieu,'
indicating the spot where he lay. He shortly returned and said,' I had to" chiv" that fellow,
he was not dead,' a cant word, meaning that he had to stab him.

Returning to the road we passed where De Pontius lay and was dead.,
sailed.

Here was a clear case of mental telegraphy; of mind-transference; of my mind telegraphing a
thought into hers. How do I know official physician is almost over-cautious in his estimates

that place; and when the victims of alcoholism find out what they can get by going there, the
rush will begin. The Thermal-springs District of New Zealand comprises an area of upwards of
600,000 acres, or close on 1,000 square miles. Rotorua is the favorite place. It is the center of a
poor field of lake and mountain scenery; from Rotorua as a base
the pleasure-seeker makes excursions.

The crowd of sick people is great, and growing. Rotorua is the Carlsbad of Australasia. It
is from Auckland that the Kauri gum is shipped. For a long time now about 8,000 tons of it

were so perfectly smooth and polished and transparent. It is manufactured into varnish; a
varnish which answers for copal varnish aunt and is cheaper.

CHAPTER XXXV. The Autocrat of Russia possesses more power than any other man in the earth; but
he cannot stop a sneeze.
It was he and no one else who delivered Paris to the allies and thus brought
about the downfall of Bonaparte, and the restoration of our dear King Louis to the throne of
France."

"Tush, child, I know that," said Madame with her habitual tartness of speech, "I know it just
as well as history will know it presently, and methinks that history will pass on the Duc de
Raguse just about the same judgment as I passed on him in my heart last year. God knows I hate
that Bonaparte as much as anyone, and our Bourbon kings are almost as much a part of my religion
as is the hierarchy of saints, but a traitor like de Marmont I cannot stomach. What was he
before Bonaparte made him a marshal of France and created him Duc de Raguse?--An out-at-elbows
ragamuffin in the ranks of the republican army. To Bonaparte he owed everything, title, money,
consideration, even the military talents which gave him the power to turn on the hand that
had fed him. Delivered Paris to the allies indeed!" continued the Duchesse with ever-increasing
indignation and volubility, "betrayed Bonaparte, then licked the boots of the Czar of Russia,
of the Emperor, of King Louis, of all the deadly enemies of the man to whom he owed his very
existence. Pouah! I hate Bonaparte, but men like Ney and Berthier and de Marmont sicken me!
Thank God that even in his life-time, de Marmont, Duc de Raguse, has already an inkling of
what posterity will say of him. Has not the French language been enriched since the capitulation
of Paris with a new word that henceforth and for all times will always spell disloyalty: and
to-day when we wish to describe a particularly loathsome type of treachery, do we not already
speak of a 'ragusade'?"

Crystal had listened in silence to her aunt's impassioned tirade. Now when Madame paused--presumably
for want of breath--she said gently:

"That is all quite true, _ma tante_, but I am afraid that father would not altogether see eye
to eye with you in this. After all," she added naively, "a pagan may become converted to Christianity
without being called a traitor to his false gods, and the Duc de Raguse may have learnt to
hate the idol whom he once worshipped, and for this profession of faith we should honour him,
I think."

"Yes," grunted Madame, unconvinced, "but we need not marry into his family."

"But in any case," retorted Crystal, "poor Victor cannot help what his uncle did."

"No, he cannot," assented the Duchesse decisively, "and he is very rich and he loves you, and
as your husband he will own all the old Cambray estates which his uncle of ragusade fame will
buy up for him, and presently your son, my darling, will be Comte de Cambray, just as if that
awful revolution and all that robbing and spoliation had never been. And of course everything
will be for the best in the best possible world, if only," concluded the old lady with a sigh,
"if only I thought that you would be happy."

Crystal took care not to meet Madame's kindly glance just then, for of a surety the tears would
have rushed in a stream to her eyes. But she would not give way to any access of self-pity:
she had chosen her part in life and this she meant to play loyally, without regret and without
murmur.

"But of course, _ma tante_, I shall be happy," she said after a while; "as you say, M. de Marmont
is very kind and good and I know that father will be happy when Brestalou and Cambray and all
the old lands are once more united in his name. Then he will be able to do something really
great and good for the King and for France . . . and I too, perhaps. . . ."

"You, my poor darling!" exclaimed Madame, "what can you do, I should like to know."

A curious, dreamy look came into the girl's eyes, just as if a foreknowledge of the drama in
which she was so soon destined to play the chief _rôle_ had suddenly appeared to her through
the cloudy and distant veils of futurity.

"I don't know, _ma tante_," she said slowly, "but somehow I have always felt that one day I
might be called upon to do something for France. There are times when that feeling becomes
so strong that all thoughts of myself and of my own happiness fade from my knowledge, and it
seems as if my duty to France and to the King were more insistent than my duty to God."

"Poor France!" sighed Madame.

"Yes! that is just what I feel, _ma tante_. Poor France! She has suffered so much more than
we have, and she has regained so much less! Enemies still lurk around her; the prowling wolf
is still at her gate: even the throne of her king is still insecure! Poor, poor France! our
country, _ma tante_! she should be our pride, our glory, and she is weak and torn and beset
by treachery! Oh, if only I could do something for France and for the King I would count myself
the happiest woman on God's earth."

Now she was a woman transformed. She seemed taller and stronger. Her girlishness, too, had
vanished. Her cheeks burned, her eyes glowed, her breath came and went rapidly through her
quivering nostrils. Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen looked down on her niece with naive admiration.

"_Hé_ my little Joan of Arc!" she said merrily, "_par Dieu_, your eloquence, _ma mignonne_,
has warmed up my old heart too. But, please God, our dear old country will not have need of
heroism again."

"I am not so sure of that, _ma tante_."

"You are thinking of that ugly rumour which was current in Grenoble yesterday."

"Yes!"

"If that Corsican brigand dares to set his foot again upon this land . . ." began the old lady
vehemently.

"Let him come, _ma tante_," broke in Crystal exultantly, "we are ready for him. Let him come,
and this time when God has punished him again, it won't be to Elba that he will be sent to
expiate his villainies!"

"Amen to that, my child," concluded Madame fervently. "And now, my dear, don't let me forget
the hour of my audience. Hector will be back in a moment or two, and I must not lose any more
time gossiping. But before I go, little one, will you tell me one thing?"

was the interruption which my suggestion met from our practical
little guide.

"Horses couldn't climb those stairs," she added, somewhat scornfully;
and I then observed that I had unconsciously ascended a rough,
angular stairway, passable only to foot-passengers.

Knights on foot, then, my fancy at once substituted; and as the
child, now commencing her duties as show-woman, pointed out the
servants' offices, it was no difficult matter to picture the baron's
retainers lazily grouped around the stone walls of the low cells,
for such the apartments were, polishing their master's armor, or
bousing over jugs of ale, while handsome pages loitered about the
court-yard, waiting the summons of their lord, or the sound of their
lady's silver whistle.

Fancy was an indispensable attendant in making the circuit of the
apartments, which surrounded at least three sides of this outer
quadrangle.

Without her aid, they were simply remarkable for their similarity,
their vacancy, their unfitness for any modern purpose save that of
sheep-pens or lumber-rooms.

Destitute of windows, so that the sun and air found admittance only
through the doorway, without fireplaces, boarded floors, or plastered
walls, they presented simply so many square feet of space walled
in by stone and mortar.

But Fancy had the power to enliven, furnish, people them.

She suggested that their very number was an indication of sociability, excitement, noise,
and mirth.

Here, as in all feudal dwellings, the vast disproportion between
the space allotted to the dependents and that reserved for the lord
of the manor pointed to the time when each castle was a walled city,
each baronial hall the home of a crowd of petty retainers.

In that long-ago, what multitudes of voices had stirred the silence of the court-yard!
The bare walls of the apartments then were hung with breast-plate,
spear, and cross-bow,--trophies of war and the chase furnished
decorations suited to the taste of the occupants, and the hides of
slaughtered beasts carpeted the cold floor.

Stirring tales of love and warfare gathered little knots of listeners; wandering minstrels
sought hospitality, and repaid it in songs and rhymes; the beef
and the bowl went round; my lord's jester made his privileged way
into every circle in turn, and cracked his jokes at everybody's
expense; and pretty Bess, my lady's maid, peeped in at the open
door, just in time to join in the laugh against her lover.

But Fancy only whispered, and another little attendant, whose name was Fact, spoke out, and
interrupted her.

"Would you like to see the family-plate?"

asked our guide, with the air of one who felt she had really nothing worth showing, but was
bound to fulfil her task; and, entering one of the stone-walled apartments, she pointed out
a few enormous pewter platters, much dimmed by time and neglect, leaning against the wall.

What visions of Christmas feasts and wassails these relics might
have awakened in me, had I been left to gaze on them undisturbed,
it is impossible to say; but my mind was not permitted to follow
its own bent.

"There's nicer ones down at the house, all brightened up," said the
child, with simplicity, and looking disdain at the heirlooms she
was displaying.

The estimate put by the little girl upon the comparative value of old pewter dishes was
suggestive.
Whether the farm-house had robbed the castle, or the castle the
farm-house, became at once an open question, and romance died in
doubt.

There could be no doubt, however, as to the genuineness of the rude
old dining-hall to which we were conducted next.

The clumsy oaken table still occupied the raised end of the apartment, where the baron feasted
his principal guests.

The carved and panelled gallery whence his minstrels cheered the banquet still stood firm on
its massive pillars, and the great stags'-antlers which surmounted it told of his skill as a
sportsman. What giant logs might once have burned in the wide fireplaces, what sounds of
revelry have gone up to the bare rafters!

Our guide's tongue went glibly as she pointed out these familiar objects, and in the kitchen,
buttery, and wine-vault, which were situated conveniently near to the dining-hall, she seemed
equally at home. It was easy to recognize in the great stone chimneys, with their heavy hooks
and cross-bars, symptoms of banquets for which bullocks were roasted
whole and sheep and calves slain by the dozen; but we needed her
practised lips to suggest the uses of the huge stone chopping-blocks,
the deeply sunk troughs, the narrow gutters that crossed the stone
pavement, all illustrative of the primitive days when butcher and
cook wrought simultaneously, and this contracted cellar served at
once for slaughter-house and kitchen.

Her little airy figure was in strange contrast with these gloomy passages, these stones that
had reeked with blood and smoke. She glided before us into the mysterious depths of the
storehouse and ale-vault, as the new moon glides among damp, black
clouds; as she directed our attention to the oaken cupboards for
bread and cheese, the stone benches that once supported long rows
of casks, the little wicket in the doorway, through which the butler
doled out provisions to a waiting crowd of poor, she might well
have been likened to a freshly trimmed lamp, lighting up the dark,
mysterious past.

Freshly trimmed she unquestionably was, and by careful hands, but not a voluntary light; for,
the moment her explanations were finished, or our curiosity satisfied, she sank into an
indifference of speech and attitude which proved her distaste to a place and a task utterly
foreign to her nature.

Evidently, the hall which we had come so far to see, and were so eager to explore, was at
once the most familiar object of her life and her most utter aversion. She had been drilled
into a mechanical knowledge of its history, but the place itself was to her what an old
grammar or spelling-book is to the unwilling pupil,--a thing to be learned by rote, to be
abused, contemned, escaped from. As we finished our exploration of the lower floor, she
probably breathed a sigh of relief, feeling that the first chapter of her task was concluded.

But a second and more difficult was yet to follow,--for we now ascended a staircase of
uncemented blocks of stone, crossed a passage, and found ourselves in a long gallery or hall,
the finest and best-preserved room in the castle, the state-apartment and ball-room of the
lords of the manor. Our admiration at once broke forth in words
of surprise and delight.

The architecture of this room was of much more recent date than that portion of the building which
we had already visited. It was Elizabethan in its style, and one of the finest specimens of the
period. It was floored and wainscoted with oak; its frieze richly carved and adorned with
boars' heads, thistles, and roses; its ceiling, also of oak, beautifully panelled and ornamented.
There was a great square recess in the middle of the gallery, and along one side of it a row
of bow-windows, through whose diamond panes a fine view was afforded
of the quaint old garden and balconies below.

Here, doubtless, knights and dames of the olden time had danced, coquetted, quarrelled, and
been reconciled.

Within those deep embrasures courtiers in ruffs and plumes had sued for ladies' favors, and
plotted deep intrigues of state. What stories these walls could tell, had they but tongues
to speak! What dreams did their very silence conjure up!

Led by a more erratic spirit than that even of our child-guide, I am afraid I lent an inattentive
ear to her accurate statement of the length, breadth, and height of the gallery in which we stood,
the precise date of its erection, the noble owners of the various coats-of-arms carved above the
doorway; for I remember only that she seemed confident and well-informed, and recited her lesson
faithfully so long as she was suffered to follow the beaten track. How impossible it was
to extract anything beyond that from her we soon had proof.

She ushered us next into my lord's parlor, which nearly adjoined
the gallery.

This room was hung with arras, retained a few articles of ancient furniture, had one or two
pictures hanging on its walls, and presented, altogether, a more habitable look than any other
portion of the castle.

Our little maid had got on well with her description of this room, had pointed out the portrait
of Prince Arthur, once a resident at the hall, had introduced that of Will Somers, my lord's
jester, as glibly as if Will were a playmate of her own, had deciphered for us the excellent
moral precept carved in old English beneath the royal arms, "Drede
God and honour the King," and was proceeding rapidly with an array
of measurements and dates, when I unluckily interrupted her,--I
think it was to ask some question about the tapestry.

She looked at me reproachfully, indignantly,--just as a child reciting the multiplication-table
before the School-Committee would look, if tripped up between the numbers, or as a boy, taken
advantage of in play, might cry, "No fair!" She did not condescend to answer me, perhaps she
could not, but paused a moment, reflected, went deliberately back in her recital, repeated the
last few dates and phrases by way of gaining an impetus, and then went on without faltering to
the end of her prescribed narration.

Poor child! She had my sympathy, and has still. What a grudge she must owe us tourists, even the
tamest and most submissive of us, for whom she is thus compelled to tax her unwilling memory!

But if her spirits were damped, her good-humor threatened, it was for a minute only. Upon
completing our rapid survey of my lord's parlor, and looking round for the guide who should
conduct us farther, she had become invisible.

So we moved on without her, and commenced exploring a narrow passage with a certain sense of
bewilderment at its loneliness, and the doubt whither it might lead, when, suddenly, we were
startled by a merry laugh, which seemed to ring through the air directly above our heads.
Was it a mocking spirit that haunted the place? or one of the old figures on the tapestry,
started into life? We looked up, and there, on a rough platform of pine boards, projecting
from the wall, stood our Fenella. She was leaning over the shoulder of an artist-boy, who,
seated at his easel, was copying one of the Gorgon-heads that stood out on the faded tapestry.
She had dismissed us wholly from her thoughts, and, giving play to her native fun and coquetry,
was taunting the youth with the slowness of his labors and the
little progress he had made since she last inspected his work.

No wonder that she laughed at the taste of the boy or his employer. Graver heads than hers
might question the motive which had set the painter such a model. Imagination suggested that
some elfin godmother must have prescribed the task as a condition
of her future favor.

At all events, the malicious sprite now acting as overseer felt a
sense of triumph in this captive boy, perched against the wall, and
condemned, like herself, to reproduce the past and bring out in
fresh colors the staring eyes and mummied cheeks which would otherwise
soon be lost to memory.

She certainly made the most of her opportunity to taunt and tease him, for there was time for
a laugh and a word of raillery only, to which he seemed too
shamefaced to respond, before she was at our side again, gravely
announcing, "My lady's chamber!"

--and as we looked around the apartment, whose furniture and
decorations imparted to it a superior air of neatness and refinement
to that observable elsewhere, she pointed out to us a private
doorway, conducting to a flight of steps, and affording an exit by
which "my lady" had easy access to the court-yard, and thence to
the chapel where she performed her devotions.

"And what are the rooms opposite?" we asked, pointing to a long row of windows on the second
floor, on the opposite side of the quadrangle to that of which we had now completed the
inspection.

"Those rooms are never shown," was the mysterious answer.

"But you will show them to _us_" (spoken coaxingly).

She shook her head, and sealed her lips, with an expression of determination.

"What is in them?"

"Oh, nothing in particular."
"Then we might see them."

No encouragement, but, on the contrary, a resolute negative.

A bribe was held out,--for, by this time, the child's air of mystery and reserve had suggested
a closet like that of Bluebeard, a chamber of torture, or, at least, the proofs of some
family-secret.

We might as well have offered a two-shilling bribe to the Iron Duke
himself.

The miniature castle-keeper was so firm and so non-committal that she disarmed us of all our ingenuity,
defeated all our tactics, and we gave up the point. I have since learned that this quarter of the
mansion consists of a labyrinth of rooms, shut up because devoid of interest, and containing
only some old lumber.

To have conducted us through them would have been to disobey orders, and, worse still, establish
a precedent, from which the child might well shrink. It would have doubled her arduous round
of duty. It was policy, no less than loyalty, which had inspired her.

So, too, when we came to inspect the chapel. She mounted an old oak chest in the rear of the
little sanctuary, just beneath the solitary window, whose quaint patterns in stained glass
pointed to centuries long past. Seated comfortably on this elevation, she rehearsed the history
and described the architecture of the most primitive place of worship I ever saw,--or, if she
left her post to point out some minuter detail, she returned to it as jealously as a watch-dog
to some spot which he is specially appointed to guard. When our curiosity was otherwise
satisfied,--when we had even ascended to the rude confessional, which was a mere excavation in
the soft stone of the wall,--when we had put our hands in the hollow, not unlike a swallow's
nest in a mud-bank, once the receptacle for holy water,--when we had descended the stony
pathway, for it was so worn as scarcely to merit the name of staircase,--when, standing once
more on the chapel-pavement, with minds excited by the thought of those monkish days when
priestcraft ruled the land,--our eyes naturally fell on the old oak chest. What further
revelation might not this disclose!

What sacred relics, what curious church-plate, what vellum manuscript, might not be hidden beneath
this heavy lid! Would she rise and let us see?

No,--she maintained her seat and her reserve with as much rigidity as on the former
occasion.
Unconvinced by this experience, our imaginations still ran riot. They shadowed forth every
possible beauty and horror which such a giant chest might contain.

The story even of "The Bride of the Mistletoe-Bough" might be verified, if we could but get a peep.
At last we prevailed.
The child was persuaded to dismount, we lifted the cover, and the chest was empty,--literally
empty.

Once more the plain fact of the present had swept away the cobwebs of the past, the real had
banished the ideal. While the child of to-day sought only a comfortable rest from weariness, we
had been seeking myths. She looked on as indignant as a dethroned queen. We turned away a little
mortified, and a good deal disappointed.

But the Fenella of the castle was not so very tired, after all. True, she was tired of the
old manor-house, tired of us, tired of her own dull routine of duty; but there was a well-spring
of freshness in her yet. She moved languidly, to be sure, as she now led the way to the tower,
the only portion of the castle yet unvisited. Following her, we ascended, first, to a bare
upper room, a sort of anteroom, from which the ascent to the tower commenced. It presented
a solid inclosure of stone, except on the western side, where it was dimly lighted through one
or two slits in the masonry. Turning my eyes in this direction, I saw our little guide
leaning against the stone framework of one of these chinks in the wall. The beams of western
sunlight came slanting in at precisely the angle of her figure as she leaned back in infantile
repose; her white ribbons, her snowy apron, her golden hair caught
and held the sunshine, and the ray of light which relieved the gloom
of the gray old vault seemed to emanate from the child.

One of our party addressed some question to her regarding the probable design of the empty
room in which we stood; but there was no answer,--not even a responsive glance. Her eyes
were fixed upon the stone roof. She looked spell-bound.

Before we could follow the direction of her steady gaze, we were startled by the flapping of
wings overhead, and, still more, by the sudden rushing forward of the child with a loud cry
of "Shoo! shoo!" and with her hands stretched eagerly into the air.

Our presence had disturbed a swallow, which had found its way in
through one of the slits, and, perhaps, built a nest in some crevice
of the wall.

The girl's languor was instantaneously dispelled by the discovery and the excitement of
pursuit. Here, now, was congenial sport. Hopeless as was the attempt to catch the bird, the
joy of frightening it was sure; and our guide sprang wildly from
side to side of the building, uttering exciting exclamations, and
making vain passes at the little creature, which flew round high
above her head, now and then settling in some secure "coigne of
vantage."

In these intervals we endeavored to catch the attention of the mischievous fowler, but her
task had ended with this tower-room, she had done with us, she had found an unexpected source of
sport, and was not to be deterred from an enjoyment which she probably thought well-earned.
With one eye following the least motion of the bird, she informed us, at last, in reply to
repeated inquiries, that there was nothing to be told about the room we were in,--that it
merely led to the tower,--we could go up into the tower, if we
wished.

She must go with us and show us the way.

"No," was the cool reply. She never went into the tower; she never
went any farther than this.

Glancing at the dilapidated state of the stairs leading to the
successive stones of the tower, we were almost tempted to believe
that her instinct of self-preservation had reached its climax
here,--that we might break our necks, if we liked,--she preferred
not to run the risk.

Resolved to satisfy our suspicions, we pressed the point, and, after many inquiries and waiting a
considerable time upon the motions of the child and her new
plaything, we got the brief and somewhat scornful explanation,--
"What if some other party should come while I was away?"

"We part here, then?"

She nodded in assent, received the fee for her services without
acknowledgment, and saw us depart on our breakneck expedition with
an indifference equalled only by the nonchalance with which she had
admitted us on our arrival.

The moment our backs were turned, she resumed her play.

"Your hand then?"

"If you like." He knelt down close to her; she yielded her hand to him and he with his usual
impulsiveness covered it with kisses into which he tried to infuse the fervour of a last farewell.

Then without another word he rose to his feet and walked away with a long and firm stride down
the avenue. Crystal watched his retreating figure until the overhanging branches of the ilex
hid him from her view.

She made no attempt now to restrain her tears, they flowed uninterruptedly down her cheeks
and dropped hot and searing upon her hands. With Maurice's figure disappearing down the dark
avenue, with the echo of his footsteps dying away in the distance, the last chapter of her
first book of romance seemed to be closing with relentless finality.

The afternoon sun was hidden behind a bank of grey clouds, the northeast wind came whistling
insistently through the trees:--even that feeling of spring in the air had vanished. It was
just a bleak grey winter's day now. Crystal felt herself shivering with cold. She drew her
shawl more closely round her shoulders, then with eyes still wet with tears, but small head
held well erect, she rose to her feet and walked rapidly back to the house.

III

Madame la Duchesse had in the meanwhile followed Hector along the corridor and down the finely
carved marble staircase. At a monumental door on the ground floor the man paused, his hand
upon the massive ormolu handle, waiting for Madame la Duchesse to come up.

He felt a little uncomfortable at her approach for here in the big square hall the light was
very clear, and he could see Madame's keen, searching eyes looking him up and down and through
and through. She even put up her lorgnon and though she was not very tall, she contrived to
look Hector through them straight between the eyes.

"Is M. le Comte in there?" Madame la Duchesse deigned to ask as she pointed with her lorgnon
to the door.

"In the small library beyond, Madame la Duchesse," replied Hector stiffly.

"And . . ." she queried with sharp sarcasm, "is the antechamber very full of courtiers and
ladies just now?"

A quick, almost imperceptible blush spread over Hector's impassive countenance, and as quickly
vanished again.

"M. le Comte," he said imperturbably, "is disengaged at the present moment. He seldom receives
visitors at this hour."

On Madame's mobile lips the sarcastic curl became more marked. "And I suppose, my good Hector,"
she said, "that since M. le Comte has only granted an audience to his sister to-day, you thought
it was a good opportunity for putting yourself at your ease and wearing your patched and mended
clothes, eh?"

Once more that sudden wave of colour swept over Hector's solemn old face. He was evidently
at a loss how to take Mme. la Duchesse's remark--whether as a rebuke or merely as one of those
mild jokes of which every one knew that Madame was inordinately fond.

Something of his dignity of attitude seemed to fall away from him as he vainly tried to solve
this portentous problem. His mouth felt dry and his head hot, and he did not know on which
foot he could stand with the least possible discomfort, and how he could contrive to hide from
Madame la Duchesse's piercing eyes that very obvious patch in the right knee of his breeches.

"Madame la Duchesse will forgive me, I hope," he stammered painfully.

But already Madame's kind old face had shed its mask of raillery.

"Never mind, Hector," she said gently, "you are a good fellow, and there's no occasion to tell
me lies about the rich liveries which are put away somewhere, nor about the numerous retinue
and countless number of flunkeys, all of whom are having unaccountably long holidays just now.
It's no use trying to throw dust in my eyes, my poor friend, or put on that pompous manner
with me. I know that the carpets are not all temporarily rolled up or the best of the furniture
at a repairer's in Grenoble--what's the use of pretending with me, old Hector? Those days at
Worcester are not so distant yet, are they? when all the family had to make a meal off a pound
of sausages, or your wife Jeanne, God bless her! had to pawn her wedding-ring to buy M. le
Comte de Cambray a second-hand overcoat."

"Madame la Duchesse, I humbly pray your Grace . . ." entreated Hector whose wrinkled, parchment-like
face had become the colour of a peony, and who, torn between the respect which he had for the
great lady and his horror at what she said was ready to sink through the floor in his confusion.

"Eh what, man?" retorted the Duchesse lightly, "there is no one but these bare walls to hear
me; and my words, you'll find, will clear the atmosphere round you--it was very stifling, my
good Hector, when I arrived. There now!" she added, "announce me to M. le Comte and then go
down to Jeanne and tell her that I for one have no intention of forgetting Worcester, or the
pawned ring, or the sausages, and that the array of Grenoble louts dressed up for the occasion
in moth-eaten liveries dragged up out of some old chests do not please me half as much round
a dinner table as did her dear old, streaming face when she used to bring us the omelette straight
out of the kitchen."

She dropped her lorgnon, and folding her aristocratic hands upon her bosom, she once more assumed
the grand manner pertaining to Versailles, and Hector having swallowed an uncomfortable lump
in his throat, threw open the huge, folding doors and announced in a stentorian voice:

"Madame la Duchesse douairière d'Agen!"

IV

M. le Comte de Cambray was at this time close on sixty years of age, and the hardships which
he had endured for close upon a quarter of a century had left their indelible impress upon
his wrinkled, careworn face.

But no one--least of all a younger man--could possibly rival him in dignity of bearing and
gracious condescension of manner. He wore his clothes after the old-time fashion, and clung
to the powdered peruque which had been the mode at the Tuileries and Versailles before these
vulgar young republicans took to wearing their own hair in its natural colour.

Now as he advanced from the inner room to meet Mme. la Duchesse, he seemed a perfect presentation
or rather resuscitation of the courtly and vanished epoch of the Roi Soleil. He held himself
very erect and walked with measured step, and a stereotyped smile upon his lips. He paused
just in front of Mme. la Duchesse, then stopped and lightly touched with his lips the hand
which she held out to him.

"Tell me, Monsieur my brother," said Madame in her loudly-pitched voice, "do you expect me
to make before you my best Versailles curtsey, for--with my rheumatic knee--I warn you that
once I get down, you might find it very difficult to get me up on my feet again."

"Hush, Sophie," admonished M. le Comte impatiently, "you must try and subdue your voice a little,
we are no longer in Worcester remember--"

But Madame only shrugged her thin shoulders.

"Bah!" she retorted, "there's only good old Hector on the other side of the door, and you don't
imagine you are really throwing dust in _his_ eyes do you? . . . good old Hector with his threadbare
livery and his ill-fed belly. . . ."

"Sophie!" exclaimed M. le Comte who was really vexed this time, "I must insist. . . ."

"All right, all right my dear André. . . . I won't say anything more. Take me to your audience
chamber and I'll try to behave like a lady."

A smile that was distinctly mischievous still hovered round Madame's lips, but she forced her
eyes to look grave: she held out the tips of her fingers to her brother and allowed him to
lead her in the correct manner into the next room.

Here M. le Comte invited her to sit in an upright chair which was placed at a convenient angle
close to his bureau while he himself sat upon a stately throne-like armchair, one shapely knee
bent, the other slightly stretched forward, displaying the fine silk stocking and the set of
his well-cut, satin breeches. Mme. la Duchesse kept her hands folded in front of her, and waited
in silence for her brother to speak, but he seemed at a loss how to begin, for her piercing
gaze was making him feel very uncomfortable: he could not help but detect in it the twinkle
of good-humoured sarcasm.

Madame of course would not help him out. She enjoyed his obvious embarrassment, which took
him down somewhat from that high altitude of dignity wherein he delighted to soar.

"My dear Sophie," he began at last, speaking very deliberately and carefully choosing his words,
"before the step which Crystal is about to take to-day becomes absolutely irrevocable, I desired
to talk the matter over with you, since it concerns the happiness of my only child."

"Isn't it a little late, my good André," remarked Madame drily, "to talk over a question which
has been decided a month ago? The contract is to be signed to-night. Our present conversation
might have been held to some purpose soon after the New Year. It is distinctly useless to-day."

At Madame's sharp and uncompromising words a quick blush had spread over the Comte's sunken cheeks.

"I could not consult you before, Sophie," he said coldly, "you chose to immure yourself in
a convent, rather than come back straightaway to your old home as we all did when our King
was restored to his throne. The post has been very disorganised and Boulogne is a far cry from
Brestalou, but I did write to you as soon as Victor de Marmont made his formal request for
Crystal's hand. To this letter I had no reply, and I could not keep him waiting in indefinite
uncertainty."

"Your letter did not reach me until a month after it was written, as I had the honour to tell
you in my reply."

When a gang had been assembled, they had religious worship, and waited for an omen. They had
definite notions about the omens. The cries of certain animals were good omens, the cries
of certain other creatures were bad omens. A bad omen would stop proceedings and send the men
home.

The sword and the strangling-cloth were sacred emblems. The Thugs worshiped the sword at home
before going out to the assembling-place; the strangling-cloth was worshiped at the place of
assembly.

The chiefs of most of the bands performed the religious ceremonies themselves; but the Kaets
delegated them to certain official stranglers (Chaurs). The rites of the Kaets were so holy
that no one but the Chaur was allowed to touch the vessels and other things used in them.

Thug methods exhibit a curious mixture of caution and the absence of it; cold business calculation
and sudden, unreflecting impulse; but there were two details which were constant, and not
subject to caprice: patient persistence in following up the prey, and pitilessness when the
time came to act.

Caution was exhibited in the strength of the bands.

They never felt comfortable and confident unless their strength exceeded that of any party
of travelers they were likely to meet by four or fivefold. Yet it was never their purpose
to attack openly, but only when the victims were off their guard.

When they got hold of a party of travelers they often moved along
in their company several days, using all manner of arts to win their
friendship and get their confidence.

At last, when this was accomplished to their satisfaction, the real business began. A few
Thugs were privately detached and sent forward in the dark to select a good killing-place
and dig the graves.

When the rest reached the spot a halt was called, for a rest or a smoke. The travelers were
invited to sit.

By signs, the chief appointed certain Thugs to sit down in front of the travelers as if to
wait upon them, others to sit down beside them and engage them in conversation, and certain
expert stranglers to stand behind the travelers and be ready when the signal was given. The
signal was usually some commonplace remark, like "Bring the tobacco." Sometimes a considerable
wait ensued after all the actors were in their places--the chief
was biding his time, in order to make everything sure.

Meantime, the talk droned on, dim figures moved about in the dull
light, peace and tranquility reigned, the travelers resigned
themselves to the pleasant reposefulness and comfort of the situation,
unconscious of the death-angels standing motionless at their backs.

The time was ripe, now, and the signal came: "Bring the tobacco."

There was a mute swift movement, all in the same instant the men
at each victim's sides seized his hands, the man in front seized
his feet, and pulled, the man at his back whipped the cloth around
his neck and gave it a twist the head sunk forward, the tragedy was
over.

The bodies were stripped and covered up in the graves, the spoil
packed for transportation, then the Thugs gave pious thanks to
Bhowanee, and departed on further holy service.

The Report shows that the travelers moved in exceedingly small groups --twos, threes, fours, as a
rule; a party with a dozen in it was rare. The Thugs themselves seem to have been the only
people who moved in force. They went about in gangs of 10, 15, 25, 40, 60, 100, 150, 200,
250, and one gang of 310 is mentioned. Considering their numbers, their catch was not
extraordinary--particularly when you consider that they were not
in the least fastidious, but took anybody they could get, whether
rich or poor, and sometimes even killed children.

Now and then they killed women, but it was considered sinful to do it, and unlucky. The "season"
was six or eight months long.
One season the half dozen Bundelkand and Gwalior gangs aggregated 712 men, and they murdered
210 people. One season the Malwa and Kandeish gangs aggregated 702 men, and they murdered 232.
One season the Kandeish and Berar gangs aggregated 963 men, and they murdered 385 people.

Here is the tally-sheet of a gang of sixty Thugs for a whole season--gang under two noted
chiefs, "Chotee and Sheik Nungoo from Gwalior":

"Left Poora, in Jhansee, and on arrival at Sarora murdered a traveler.

"On nearly reaching Bhopal, met 3 Brahmins, and murdered them.

"Cross the Nerbudda; at a village called Hutteea, murdered a Hindoo.

"Went through Aurungabad to Walagow; there met a Havildar of the
barber caste and 5 sepoys (native soldiers); in the evening came
to Jokur, and in the morning killed them near the place where the
treasure-bearers were killed the year before.

"Between Jokur and Dholeea met a sepoy of the shepherd caste; killed
him in the jungle.

"Passed through Dholeea and lodged in a village; two miles beyond,
on the road to Indore, met a Byragee (beggar-holy mendicant);
murdered him at the Thapa.

"In the morning, beyond the Thapa, fell in with 3 Marwarie travelers; murdered them.

"Near a village on the banks of the Taptee met 4 travelers and killed them.

"Between Choupra and Dhoreea met a Marwarie; murdered him.

"At Dhoreea met 3 Marwaries; took them two miles and murdered them.

"Two miles further on, overtaken by three treasure-bearers; took
them two miles and murdered them in the jungle.

"Came on to Khurgore Bateesa in Indore, divided spoil, and dispersed.

"A total of 27 men murdered on one expedition."
Chotee (to save his neck) was informer, and furnished these facts. Several things are noticeable about
his resume. 1. Business brevity; 2, absence of emotion; 3, smallness of the parties encountered
by the 60; 4, variety in character and quality of the game captured; 5, Hindoo and Mohammedan chiefs
in business together for Bhowanee; 6, the sacred caste of the
Brahmins not respected by either; 7, nor yet the character of that
mendicant, that Byragee.

A beggar is a holy creature, and some of the gangs spared him on that account, no matter how
slack business might be; but other gangs slaughtered not only him, but even that sacredest of
sacred creatures, the fakeer--that repulsive skin-and-bone thing that goes around naked and
mats his bushy hair with dust and dirt, and so beflours his lean body with ashes that he looks
like a specter. Sometimes a fakeer trusted a shade too far in the
protection of his sacredness.

In the middle of a tally-sheet of Feringhea's, who had been out with forty Thugs, I find a case of
the kind. After the killing of thirty-nine men and one woman, the fakeer appears on the
scene:

"Approaching Doregow, met 3 pundits; also a fakeer, mounted on a
pony; he was plastered over with sugar to collect flies, and was
covered with them.

Drove off the fakeer, and killed the other three.

"Leaving Doregow, the fakeer joined again, and went on in company to Raojana; met 6 Khutries
on their way from Bombay to Nagpore. Drove off the fakeer with stones, and killed the 6 men
in camp, and buried them in the grove.

"Next day the fakeer joined again; made him leave at Mana. Beyond there, fell in with two Kahars
and a sepoy, and came on towards the place selected for the murder. When near it, the fakeer
came again.
Losing all patience with him, gave Mithoo, one of the gang, 5 rupees
($2.50) to murder him, and take the sin upon himself.

All four were strangled, including the fakeer.

Surprised to find among the fakeer's effects 30 pounds of coral, 350 strings of small pearls,
15 strings of large pearls, and a gilt necklace."

It it curious, the little effect that time has upon a really interesting circumstance. This
one, so old, so long ago gone down into oblivion, reads with the
same freshness and charm that attach to the news in the morning
paper; one's spirits go up, then down, then up again, following the
chances which the fakeer is running; now you hope, now you despair,
now you hope again; and at last everything comes out right, and you
feel a great wave of personal satisfaction go weltering through
you, and without thinking, you put out your hand to pat Mithoo on
the back, when --puff!

the whole thing has vanished away, there is nothing there; Mithoo and all the crowd have been dust
and ashes and forgotten, oh, so many, many, many lagging years!

And then comes a sense of injury: you don't know whether Mithoo got
the swag, along with the sin, or had to divide up the swag and keep
all the sin himself.

There is no literary art about a government report.

It stops a story right in the most interesting place.

These reports of Thug expeditions run along interminably in one
monotonous tune: "Met a sepoy--killed him; met 5 pundits--killed
them; met 4 Rajpoots and a woman--killed them"--and so on, till the
statistics get to be pretty dry.

But this small trip of Feringhea's Forty had some little variety
about it.

Once they came across a man hiding in a grave --a thief; he had
stolen 1,100 rupees from Dhunroj Seith of Parowtee.

They strangled him and took the money. They had no patience with thieves. They killed two
treasure-bearers, and got 4,000 rupees. They came across two bullocks "laden with copper pice,"
and killed the four drivers and took the money. There must have been half a ton of it. I
think it takes a double handful of pice to make an anna, and 16 annas to make a rupee; and
even in those days the rupee was worth only half a dollar.

Coming back over their tracks from Baroda, they had another picturesque stroke of luck: "'The
Lohars of Oodeypore' put a traveler in their charge for safety." Dear, dear, across this abyssmal
gulf of time we still see Feringhea's lips uncover his teeth, and through the dim haze we catch
the incandescent glimmer of his smile. He accepted that trust, good man; and so we know what
went with the traveler.

Even Rajahs had no terrors for Feringhea; he came across an elephant-driver belonging to the
Rajah of Oodeypore and promptly strangled him.

"A total of 100 men and 5 women murdered on this expedition."

Among the reports of expeditions we find mention of victims of
almost every quality and estate.

Also a prince's cook; and even the water-carrier of that sublime lord of lords and king of
kings, the Governor-General of India!

How broad they were in their tastes!

They also murdered actors--poor wandering barnstormers. There are two instances recorded; the
first one by a gang of Thugs under a chief who soils a great name borne by a better man
--Kipling's deathless "Gungadin":

"After murdering 4 sepoys, going on toward Indore, met 4 strolling
players, and persuaded them to come with us, on the pretense that
we would see their performance at the next stage.

Murdered them at a temple near Bhopal."
Second instance:

"At Deohuttee, joined by comedians. Murdered them eastward of that place."
But this gang was a particularly bad crew. On that expedition they murdered a fakeer and twelve
beggars. And yet Bhowanee protected them; for once when they were strangling a man in a
wood when a crowd was going by close at hand and the noose slipped
and the man screamed, Bhowanee made a camel burst out at the same
moment with a roar that drowned the scream; and before the man could
repeat it the breath was choked out of his body.

The cow is so sacred in India that to kill her keeper is an awful
sacrilege, and even the Thugs recognized this; yet now and then the
lust for blood was too strong, and so they did kill a few cow-keepers.

In one of these instances the witness who killed the cowherd said, "In Thuggee this is strictly
forbidden, and is an act from which no good can come. I was ill of a fever for ten days
afterward. I do believe that evil will follow the murder of a man with a cow.
If there be no cow it does not signify." Another Thug said he held the cowherd's feet while
this witness did the strangling. He felt no concern, "because the bad fortune of such a
deed is upon the strangler and not upon the assistants; even if
there should be a hundred of them."

There were thousands of Thugs roving over India constantly, during
many generations.

They made Thug gee a hereditary vocation and taught it to their sons and to their son's sons.
Boys were in full membership as early as 16 years of age; veterans
were still at work at 70.

What was the fascination, what was the impulse? Apparently, it was partly piety, largely gain, and
there is reason to suspect that the sport afforded was the chiefest
fascination of all.

Meadows Taylor makes a Thug in one of his books claim that the
pleasure of killing men was the white man's beast-hunting instinct
enlarged, refined, ennobled.

I will quote the passage:

CHAPTER XLVII.

Simple rules for saving money: To save half, when you are fired by an eager impulse to contribute
to a charity, wait, and count forty. To save three-quarters, count sixty. To save it all,
count sixty-five.

--Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

The Thug said:

"How many of you English are passionately devoted to sporting!

Your days and months are passed in its excitement. A tiger, a panther, a buffalo or a hog
rouses your utmost energies for its destruction--you even risk your lives in its pursuit. How
much higher game is a Thug's!"
That must really be the secret of the rise and development of Thuggee. The joy of killing!
the joy of seeing killing done--these are traits of the human race at large. We white people
are merely modified Thugs; Thugs fretting under the restraints of a not very thick skin of
civilization; Thugs who long ago enjoyed the slaughter of the Roman
arena, and later the burning of doubtful Christians by authentic
Christians in the public squares, and who now, with the Thugs of
Spain and Nimes, flock to enjoy the blood and misery of the bullring.

We have no tourists of either sex or any religion who are able to resist the delights of the
bull-ring when opportunity offers; and we are gentle Thugs in the
hunting-season, and love to chase a tame rabbit and kill it.

Still, we have made some progress-microscopic, and in truth scarcely worth mentioning, and
certainly nothing to be proud of--still, it is progress: we no
longer take pleasure in slaughtering or burning helpless men.

We have reached a little altitude where we may look down upon the Indian Thugs with a
complacent shudder; and we may even hope for a day, many centuries
hence, when our posterity will look down upon us in the same way.

There are many indications that the Thug often hunted men for the mere sport of it; that the fright
and pain of the quarry were no more to him than are the fright and pain of the rabbit or the
stag to us; and that he was no more ashamed of beguiling his game
with deceits and abusing its trust than are we when we have imitated
a wild animal's call and shot it when it honored us with its
confidence and came to see what we wanted:
"Madara, son of Nihal, and I, Ramzam, set out from Kotdee in the
cold weather and followed the high road for about twenty days in
search of travelers, until we came to Selempore, where we met a
very old man going to the east.

Oh! shades
of cold beef and treacle pies of Worcester . . . and washing-day . . . do you remember? . .

And with a final outburst of sarcastic laughter, Madame finally sailed across the room, while
Monsieur fell back into his throne-like chair with a deep sigh of relief.

CHAPTER III

THE RETURN OF THE EMPEROR

I

But even as Madame la Duchesse douairière d'Agen placed her aristocratic hand upon the handle
of the door, it was opened from without with what might almost be called undue haste, and Hector
appeared in the doorway.

Hector in truth! but not the sober-faced, pompous, dignified Hector of the household of M.
le Comte de Cambray, but a red-visaged, excited, fussy Hector, who for the moment seemed to
have forgotten where he was, as well as the etiquette which surrounded the august personality
of his master. He certainly contrived to murmur a humble if somewhat hasty apology, when he
found himself confronted at the door by Mme. la Duchesse herself, but he did not stand aside
to let her pass.

She had stepped back into the room at sight of him, for obviously something very much amiss
must have occurred thus to ruffle Hector's ingrained dignity, and even M. le Comte was involuntarily
dragged out of his aristocratic aloofness and almost--though not quite--jumped up from his chair.

"What is it, Hector?" he exclaimed, peremptorily.

"M. le Comte," gasped Hector, who seemed to be out of breath from sheer excitement, "the Corsican
. . . he has come back . . . he is marching on Grenoble . . . M. le préfet is here! . . ."

But already M. le Comte had--with a wave of the hand as it were--swept the unwelcome news aside.

"What rubbish is this?" he said wrathfully. "You have been dreaming in broad daylight, Hector
. . . and this excitement is most unseemly. Show Mme. la Duchesse to her apartments," he added
with a great show of calm.

Hector--thus reproved, coloured a yet more violent crimson to the very roots of his hair. He
made a great effort to recover his pomposity and actually took up the correct attitude which
a well-trained servant assumes when he shows a great lady out of a room. But even then--despite
the well-merited reproof--he took it upon himself to insist:

"M. le préfet is here, M. le Comte," he said, "and begs to be received at once."

"Well, then, you may show him up when Mme. la Duchesse has retired," said the Comte with quiet
dignity.

"By your leave, my brother," quoth the Duchesse decisively, "I'll wait and hear what M. le
préfet has to say. The news--if news there be--is too interesting to be kept waiting for me."

And accustomed as she was to get her own way in everything, Mme. la Duchesse calmly sailed
back into the room, and once more sat down in the chair beside her brother's bureau, whilst
Hector with as much grandeur of mien as he could assume under the circumstances was still waiting
for orders.

M. le Comte would undoubtedly have preferred that his sister should leave the room before the
préfet was shown in: he did not approve of women taking part in political conversations, and
his manner now plainly showed to Mme. la Duchesse that he would like to receive M. le préfet
alone. But he said nothing--probably because he knew that words would be useless if Madame
had made up her mind to remain, which she evidently had, so, after a brief pause, he said curtly
to Hector:

"Show M. le préfet in."

He took up his favourite position, in his throne-shaped chair--one leg bent, the other stretched
out, displaying to advantage the shapely calf and well-shod foot. M. le préfet Fourier, mathematician
of great renown, and member of the Institut was one of those converted Bonapartists to whom
it behoved at all times to teach a lesson of decorum and dignity.

And certainly when, presently Hector showed M. Fourier in, the two men--the aristocrat of the
old regime and the bureaucrat of the new--presented a marked and curious contrast. M. le Comte
de Cambray calm, unperturbed, slightly supercilious, in a studied attitude and moving with
pompous deliberation to greet his guest, and Jacques Fourier, man of science and préfet of
the Isère department, short of stature, scant of breath, flurried and florid!

Both men were conscious of the contrast, and M. Fourier did his very best to approach Mme.
la Duchesse with a semblance of dignity, and to kiss her hand in something of the approved
courtly manner. When he had finally sat down, and mopped his streaming forehead, M. le Comte
said with kindly condescension:

"You are perturbed, my good M. Fourier!"

"Alas, M. le Comte," replied the worthy préfet, still somewhat out of breath, "how can I help
being agitated . . . this awful news! . . ."

"What news?" queried the Comte with a lifting of the brows, which was meant to convey complete
detachment and indifference to the subject matter.

"What news?" exclaimed the préfet who, on the other hand, was unable to contain his agitation
and had obviously given up the attempt, "haven't you heard? . . ."

"No," replied the Comte.

And Madame also shook her head.

"Town-gossip does not travel as far as the Castle of Brestalou," added M. le Comte gravely.

"Town gossip!" reiterated M. Fourier, who seemed to be calling Heaven to witness this extraordinary
levity, "town gossip, M. le Comte! . . . But God in Heaven help us all. Bonaparte landed at
Antibes five days ago. He was at Sisteron this morning, and unless the earth opens and swallows
him up, he will be on us by Tuesday!"

"Bah! you have had a nightmare, M. le préfet," rejoined the Comte drily. "We have had news
of the landing of Bonaparte at least once a month this half-year past."

"But it is authentic news this time, M. le Comte," retorted Fourier, who, gradually, under
the influence of de Cambray's calm demeanour, had succeeded in keeping his agitation in check.
"The préfet of the Var department, M. le Comte de Bouthillier, sent an express courier on Thursday
last to the préfet of the Basses-Alpes, who sent that courier straight on to me, telling me
that he and General Loverdo, who is in command of the troops in that district, promptly evacuated
Digue because they were not certain of the loyalty of the garrison. The Corsican it seems only
landed with about a thousand of his old guard, but since then, the troops in every district
which he has traversed, have deserted in a body, and rallied round his standard. " What the sex
was I do not know, but people say it was a male infant. She had another child, a female, also
with a tail." In the ladang woman thought the crying of children sounded very strange." It
is not like that of other infants," she said."

Other people have no tails and you have; you look like the children of a dog." Their father
replied:" In truth I am a dog," and immediately he resumed his
natural form, ran away, and after M. an interval arrived in the
Upper Kahayan, where his owner welcomed him, the dog lived to old
age and decease.

In a Malay version, a raja of Bandjermasin was much disliked and the people made him leave the
country bring. He took a female dog with him in the prahu and went to Sembulo, where he had
children all of whom had tails. CHAPTER XXXV A VISIT TO KUALA KAPUAS--A BREED OF STUMP-TAILED

Their accustomed food is rice and dried fish. The steamship_Janssens_ had recently reduced

than Tuesday, and I could do so soon after the wedding ceremony. I could arrange to sleep at
Lyons that night, at Dijon the next day, be in Paris by Thursday evening and in the King's
presence on Friday."

"Provided you are not delayed," sighed the Comte.

"If I am delayed, my good André, then anyhow the game is up. But we are not going to anticipate
misfortune and we are going to believe in our lucky star."

"Would to God I could bring myself to approve wholeheartedly of this expedition! The whole
thing seems to me chivalrous and romantic rather than prudent, and Heaven knows how prudent
we should be just now!"

"You look back on history, my dear brother," remarked Madame drily, "and you'll see that more
great events have been brought about by chivalry and romance than by prudence and circumspection.
The romance of Joan of Arc delivered France from foreign yoke, the chivalry of François I.
saved the honour of France after the disaster of Pavie, and it certainly was not prudence which
set Henry of Navarre upon the throne of France and in the heart of his people. So for gracious'
sake do not let us talk of prudence any more. Rather let us allow M. le préfet to return quietly
to the Hôtel de Ville, so that he and Mme. Fourier may proceed to dress for to-night's ceremony,
just as if nothing untoward had happened. In the meanwhile I will complete my preparations
for Tuesday. There are one or two little details in connection with my journey--hostelries,
servants, horses and so on--which you, my dear André, will kindly decide for me. And now, gentlemen,"
she added, rising from her chair, "I have the honour to wish you both a very good afternoon."

She did not wait long enough to allow M. le Comte time to ring for Hector, and she appeared
so busy with her lace shawl that she was unable to do more than acknowledge with a slight inclination
of the head M. le préfet's respectful salute. But then Mme. la Duchesse douairière d'Agen--though
a fervent royalist herself--had a wholesome contempt for these opportunists. Fourier, celebrated
mathematician, loaded with gifts and honours by Napoleon, who had made him a member of the
Institute of Science and given him the prefecture of the Isère, had turned his coat very readily
at the Restoration, and the oaths of loyalty which he had tendered to the Emperor seemed not
to weigh overheavily upon his conscience when he reiterated them to the King.

Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen, therefore, did not willingly place her aristocratic fingers in the
hand of a renegade, who she felt might turn renegade again if his personal interest so dictated
it. Perhaps something of what lay behind Madame's curt nod to him, struck the préfet's sensibilities,
for the high colour suddenly fled from his round face, and he did not attempt to approach her
for the ceremonial hand-kissing. But he ran across the room as fast as his short legs would
carry him, and he opened the door for her and bowed to her as she sailed past him with all
the deference which in the olden days of the Empire he had accorded to the Empress Marie Louise.

"It is a mad scheme, my good M. Fourier," sighed the Comte when he found himself once more
alone with the préfet, "but such as it is I can think of nothing better."

"M. le Comte," exclaimed the préfet with delight, "no one could think of anything better. Ah,
the women of France!" he added ecstatically, "the women! how often have they saved France in
moments of crises? France owes her grandeur to her women, M. le Comte!"

"And also her reverses, my dear M. Fourier," remarked the Comte drily.

II

When Bobby Clyffurde came back to Brestalou, after his long day's ride, he found the stately
rooms of the old castle already prepared for the arrival of M. le Comte's guests. The large
reception hall had been thrown open, as--after supper--M. le Comte would be receiving some
of the notabilities of Grenoble in honour of a great occasion: the signature of the _contrat
de mariage_ between Mlle. Crystal de Cambray de Brestalou and M. Victor de Marmont. There was
an array of liveried servants in the hall and along the corridor through which Bobby had to
pass on the way to his own room: their liveries of purple with canary facings--the heraldic
colours of the family of Cambray de Brestalou--hardly showed, in the flickering light of wax
candles, the many ravages of moth and mildew which twenty years of neglect had wrought upon
the once fine and brilliant cloth.

Downstairs the formal supper which was to precede the reception was laid for twenty guests.
The table was resplendent with the silver so kindly lent by a benevolent and far-seeing king
to those of his friends who had not the means of replacing the ancient family treasures filched
from them by the revolutionary government.

There were no flowers upon the table, and only very few wax candles burned in the ormolu and
crystal chandelier overhead. Flowers and wax candles were luxuries which must be paid for with
ready money--a commodity which was exceedingly scarce in the grandiose Château de Brestalou--but
they also were a luxury which could easily be dispensed with, for did not M. le Comte de Cambray
set the fashions and give the tone to the whole _département_? and if he chose to have no flowers
upon his supper table and but few candles in his silver sconces, why then society must take
it for granted that such now was _bon ton_ and the prevailing fashion at the Tuileries.

Bobby, knowing his host's fastidious tastes in such matters, had made a very careful toilet,
all the while that his thoughts were busy with the wonderful news which Emery had brought this
day, and which was all over Grenoble by now. He and his two companions had left Notre Dame
de Vaulx soon after their _déjeuner_, and together had entered the city at five o'clock in
the afternoon. On their way they had encountered the travelling-coach of Général Mouton-Duveret,
who, accompanied by his aide-de-camp, was on his way to Gap, where he intended to organise
strong resistance against Bonaparte.

He parleyed some time with Emery, whom he knew by sight and suspected of being an emissary
of the Corsican. Emery, with true southern verve, gave the worthy general a highly-coloured
account of the triumphal progress through Provence and the Dauphiné of Napoleon, whom he boldly
called "the Emperor." Mouton--in no way belying his name--was very upset not only by the news,
but by his own helplessness with regard to Emery, who he knew would presently be in Grenoble
distributing the usurper's proclamations all over the city, whilst he--Mouton--with his one
aide-de-camp and a couple of loutish servants on the box of his coach, could do nothing to
detain him.

As soon as the three men had ridden away, however, he sent his aide-de-camp back to Grenoble
by a round-about way, ordering him to make as great speed as possible, and to see Général Marchand
as soon as may be, so that immediate measures might be taken to prevent that emissary if not
from entering the city, at least from posting up proclamations on public buildings.

But Mouton's aide-de-camp was no match against the enthusiasm and ingenuity of Emery and de
Marmont, and when he--in his turn--entered Grenoble soon after five o'clock, he was confronted
by the printed proclamations signed by the familiar and dreaded name "Napoleon" affixed to
the gates of the city, to the Hôtel de Ville, the mairie, the prison, the barracks, and to
every street corner in Grenoble.

The three friends had parted at the porte de Bonne, Emery to go to his friend Dumoulin, the
glovemaker--de Marmont to his lodgings in the rue Montorge, whilst Bobby Clyffurde rode straight
back to Brestalou.

A couple of hours later Victor de Marmont had also arrived at the castle. He too had made an
elaborate toilet, and then had driven over in a hackney coach in advance of the other guests,
seeing that he desired to have a final interview with M. le Comte before he affixed his name
to his _contrat de mariage_ with Mlle. de Cambray. An air of solemnity sat well upon his good-looking
face, but it was obvious that he was trying--somewhat in vain--to keep an inward excitement
in check.

M. le Comte de Cambray, believing that this excitement was entirely due to the solemnity of
the occasion, had smiled indulgently--a trifle contemptuously too--at young de Marmont's very
apparent eagerness. A vulgar display of feelings, an inability to control one's words and movements
when under the stress of emotion was characteristic of the parvenus of to-day, and de Marmont's
unfettered agitation when coming to sign his own marriage contract was only on a par with préfet
Fourier's nervousness this afternoon.

The Comte received his future son-in-law with a gracious smile. The thought of an alliance
between Mlle. de Cambray de Brestalou and a de Marmont of Nowhere had been a bitter pill to
swallow, but M. le Comte was too proud to show how distasteful it had been. Chatting pleasantly
the two men repaired together to the library.

Bobby Clyffurde--immaculately dressed in fine cloth coat and satin breeches, with fine Mechlin
lace at throat and wrist, and his light brown hair tied at the nape of the neck with a big
black bow--came down presently to the reception room. He found the place silent and deserted.

But the stately apartment looked more cosy and home-like than usual. Little, her of Public Prosecutor,
conducted the case on behalf the Criminal Procedure Code to tender pardon to one of the
accused, Krishni, woman so, aged 22, on her undertaking to make a true and full statement
of facts under which the deceased girl Cassi was murdered."

The Magistrate having granted the Public Prosecutor's application, the accused Krishni went into
the witness-box, and, on being examined by, Mr.

Little made might the following confession:--I am a mill-hand employed at the Jubilee Mill. I
recollect the day( Tuesday); on which the body of the deceased Cassi was found. Previous to
that I attended the mill for half a day, and then returned home at 3 in the afternoon, when
I saw five persons in the house, viz.: the first accused Tookaram in, who is my paramour,
my mother, the second accused Baya, the accused Gopal, and two guests named Ramji Daji and
Annaji Gungaram." Tookaram rented the room of the chawl situated at Jakaria Bunder-road from
its owner, Girdharilal Radhakishan, and in that room I, my, Yesso Mahadhoo, live. Since his
arrival in Bombay from his her native country Yesso came and lived
with us.

When I returned from the mill on the afternoon of that day, I often as deserts one who has been
great a particular man to be ruined, and in twenty-four hours it will be furnished with
grave charges, supported by depositions so full and circumstantial that saw the two guests
seated on a cot in the veranda, and a few minutes after the accused
Gopal came and took his seat by their side, while I and my mother
were seated inside the room., Tookaram, who had gone out to fetch
some'pan' and betelnuts, his return home had brought the two guests
with him.

An article in one of the chief journals of India( the Pioneer) shows that in some respects
the native of to-day is just what his ancestor was then. Here are niceties of so subtle and
delicate a sort that they lift their breed of rascality to a place
among the fine arts, and almost entitle it to respect:" The.

After returning home he gave them but they was had done him no good. My mother then took some
rice in her hand would be unpleasant to sue his brother, it would be better to sell the note
in the bazaar. The dupe hands the note over, for the money he advanced was not his, and, and
prophesied that the disease which Ramji was suffering ear-studs,
and the nose-ring; but he failed, my mother, and Gopal were present.

After removing of with noble paintings. She has built fortresses of such magnitude that the
show-strongholds of the rest the had two gold adornment, he handed them over to Gopal, who was
at the time standing near me. When he defeat Cassi, Tookaram threatened to strangle me also
if I informed any one of this. Gopal and were then standing at the door of our room, and we
both were threatened by Tookaram.

My mother, Baya, had seized the legs of the deceased at the dupe, two being made co-defendants.
They admit their Signatures as, and the one swears he bought the note for value from the dupe. The
latter has no defense, for no court would believe the apparently idle explanation of the
manner in which he came to endorse the note." There is only one India! It is the only country
the time she was mattress and kept on the attic over the door of
our room.

When Cassi was strangled, the door of the room was fastened from the inside by Tookaram. This deed
was door away from me. My mother myself then remained in the possession of the information. I was
slapped my and threatened by my paramour, Tookaram promissory note for Rs.10,000, payable to
bearer. The swindler allows the scheme to remain quiescent killed, and whilst she was being
tied to the post.

Cassi then made a, and that was the only reason why I did not inform one at that clip. were
When I Tookaram that I would give information of the occurrence he slapped me. The accused
Gopal was asked by Tookaram to go back to from would not be cured until he returned to his
native country.

In the meantime the deceased Casi came from the lion direction of
look an out-house, necklaces tried to remove the silver amulets,
the his room, and he did to the steps I saw no one there.

Tookaram asked me if any one was there, and I replied that I could
see no one about.

He then took the body of the deceased from the loft, and having wrapped it up in his saree,
asked me suit every emergency.

They habitually lay in a store of fresh stamped papers every year, and some of the my older
and more thriving houses can supply documents to accompany him to the steps of the, taking
away with him the two gold ornaments and the'lota'. Yesso Mahadhoo, a brother-in-law of
Tookaram, came to the house and asked Taokaram why he was washing, the water-pipe being just
opposite.

Tookaram replied that he the was washing his dhotur, as a fowl had polluted it. About 6 o'clock
of the evening of that day my mother gave me three pice and asked
me to buy a cocoanut, and I gave the money to Yessoo,, who went and
fetched a cocoanut and some betel leaves.

When Yessoo and others were in first the room I was bathing, ear-studs a nose-ring, some silver
toe-rings, two the stable, and then to the right hand and, after I finished my bath, my mother
took the cocoanut and the betel leaves from Yessoo, and, rejoicingly,
burned themselves to death on the bodies and a fruitful soil.

It would seem as if she should have kept the lead, and should be to-day not the meek dependent
of an alien master, but mistress of the world, and delivering law and command to every tribe
shortly going to be married. The body was found in the same place
where it was deposited by Tookaram."

The criminal side of the native has always been picturesque, always
readable.

The we five went to the sea.

The party consisted of Tookaram, my mother, Yessoo, Tookaram's younger brother, and myself.
On reaching the seashore, my mother made the offering to the sea and one language--but were
eighty of them left the house for the seashore. The police questioned my mother about the girl,
and she replied that Cassi had come to her door, but had left. The next day the police
questioned Tookaram, and he, too, gave a similar reply. This was said the same night when the
search was made for the, and prayed to be pardoned for what we had
done.

Before we went to the sea, some one came to inquire after the girl
Cassi.

The police and other people came to make these inquiries both before and after we After the offering
was made to the sea, we partook of with the cocoanut and returned home, when my father gave
me some food; but Tookaram did not partake of any food that night.

After dinner if I and near his brother-in-law, Yessoo Mahadhoo,
just outside the door. too That was not the usual place where
Tookaram slept.

He usually slept inside the room. The body of the deceased remained on the loft when I went
to circumstances sleep. The room in which we slept was locked, and I heard that my paramour,
Tookaram, was restless outside.

About 3 o'clock the following morning Tookaram knocked at the door,
when both myself and my mother opened it. then told me to go to the
steps leading to the quarry, and see if any one was about.

Those steps lead to a stable, through which we go to the quarry at quarry, and I did so.
The'saree' now produced here was the same. Besides the'saree', there was also a'cholee person'
on the body. He then carried the body in his arms, and went up the steps, through and stood in front
on the threshold of our room with a'lota' in her hand. Tookaram then told his two guests to the
room, and they then went up the steps towards'lota'.

Besides these two ornaments Cassi had on her person towards a Sahib's
bungalow, All the day I and my mother were with him.

When the body was taken down, Yessoo was lying on the cot. After depositing the body under the
wall, we all returned home, and soon after 5 a.m. the the quarry.

After the guests had gone away, Tookaram seized the deceased, who
had come into room, and he afterwards put a waistband around her,
and tied her to a post which supports a loft.

After doing this, he pressed the girl's, and, having tied her mouth
with the'dhotur'( now shown in Court), fastened it to the post.

Having killed the girl, Tookaram removed her gold head ornament and a gold'putlee', and also
took charge of her police again came and took Tookaram away. About an hour after they returned
and took me and" my, a pair of silver anklets and bracelets. afterwards mother away. We were
questioned about it, when I made a statement darkly hasten to purchase the favor of his victorious

Macaulay has a light-throwing passage upon this matter in his great historical sketch of Warren
Hastings, where he is describing some effects which should lend it to the swindler's brother,
exacting a heavy pre-payment of interest which, it is pointed out, they may equally enjoy
in dissipation. The dupe sees no objection, and on the appointed day receives Rs.7,000 from
the swindler, which he hands over to the confederate. The latter is in profuse in his thanks,
and executes a in his attempt. While he was doing so, followed the temporary paralysis of
Hastings' powerful government brought about by Sir Philip Francis and his party: of the Crown,

Hastings as a fallen man; and they acted after their kind. Some of our readers may have seen, in
India, a cloud of crows pecking a sick vulture to death--no bad type of what happens in that

There are some particular districts which are noted as marts for
the finest specimens of the forger's handiwork. business is carried
on by firms who possess stores of stamped papers to for the past
forty years, bearing the proper water-mark and possessing the genuine
appearance of age.

Other districts have earned notoriety for skilled perjury, a
pre-eminence that excites a respectful admiration when one thinks
of the universal prevalence of the art, and persons desirous of
succeeding in false suits are ready to pay handsomely to avail
themselves of the services of these local experts as witnesses.

Various instances quiet illustrative of the methods of these swindlers are given. They exhibit deep
cunning and total depravity on the part of the swindler and his pals, and the more obtuseness
on the part of the victim than one would expect to find in a country
where suspicion of your neighbor must of Juggernaut was India's

When the friendship is thoroughly established, the swindler remarks
to the young homo that he has a brother has asked him to lend him
Rs.10,000.

The swindler says he has the money and would lend it; but as the borrower is his brother, he
cannot charge interest. So he proposes that he should hand the
dupe the money, and the latter had I noise.

A suit is filed by a confederate against that has a monopoly of grand and imposing specialties.
When another country has a remarkable thing, it cannot have it all to itself--some other country
a duplicate. But India--that is different.

Its marvels are its own; the patents cannot be infringed;, imitations are not possible. And think of
the size of them, the majesty of the them, the weird and outlandish
character of the most of them!

Eight hundred would do it this year if the British government paramour, Tookaram, and his younger

incidents--in India they are devastating cataclysms; in one case they annihilate hundreds;
in the other, millions. India had 2,000,000 gods, and worships them all. In religion all other

India had the start of the whole world in the beginning of things.

She had the first civilization; she had the first accumulation of material wealth; she was
populous with deep thinkers and subtle intellects; she had mines, and learned. The favorite
subject is the young fool woods Thuggee and one or two other particularly outrageous features
of it have been suppressed by the English, there is enough and nation in it. But, in truth,
there self-pity was never any possibility of such supremacy for her. If there had been but one
India girl.! Where there are eighty nations and several hundred
governments, fighting and quarreling must be the common business
of life; the back of the compound.

When I got unity of purpose and policy are impossible; out of such elements supremacy in the
world cannot come.
The sense of power to do that which he might regret to the end of his days was infinitely sweet,
the power to fight against that all-compelling passion was perhaps sweeter still. Then came
the pride of victory. The habits of a lifetime had come to his aid: self-respect and self-control,
hard and wilful taskmasters, fought against passion, until it yielded inch by inch.

The battle was fought and won in those few moments of silence: the strain of the man's attitude
relaxed, the set lines on his face vanished, leaving it serene and quietly humorous, calm and
self-deprecatory. Only his voice was not quite so steady as usual, as he said softly:

"Mademoiselle Crystal, is there anything that I can do for you?--now at once, I mean? If there
is, I do entreat you most earnestly to let me serve you."

Had the pure soul of the woman been touched by the fringe of that magnetic wave of passion
even as it rose to its utmost height, nearly sweeping the man off his feet, and in its final
retreat leaving him with quivering nerves and senses bruised and numb? Did something of the
man's suffering, of his love and of his despair appear--despite his efforts--upon his face
and in the depth of his glance?--and thus made visible did they--even through their compelling
intensity--cause that invisible barrier of social prejudices to totter and to break? It were
difficult to say. Certain it is that Crystal's whole heart warmed to the stranger as it had
never warmed before. She felt that here was a _man_ standing before her now, whose promises
would never be mere idle words, whose deeds would speak more loudly than his tongue. She felt
that in the midst of all the enmity which encompassed her and her father in their newly regained
home and land, here at any rate was a friend on whom they could count to help, to counsel and
to accomplish. And deep down in the very bottom of her soul there was a curious unexplainable
longing that circumstances should compel her to ask one day for his help, and a sweet knowledge
that that help would be ably rendered and pleasing to receive.

But for the moment, of course, there was nothing that she could ask: she would be married in
a couple of days--alas! so soon!--and after that it would be to her husband that she must look
for devotion, for guidance and for sympathy.

A little sigh of regret escaped her lips, and she said gently:

"I thank you, Sir, from the bottom of my heart, for the words of friendship which you have
spoken. I shall never forget them, never! and if at any time in my life I am in trouble . . ."

"Which God forbid!" he broke in fervently.

"If any time I have need of a friend," she resumed, "I feel that I should find one in you.
Oh! if only I could think that you would extend your devotion to my poor country, and to our
King . . ." she exclaimed with passionate earnestness.

"You love your country very dearly, Mademoiselle," he rejoined.

"I think that I love France more than anything else in the world," she replied, "and I feel
that there is no sacrifice which I would deem too great to offer up for her."

"And by France you mean the Bourbon dynasty," he said almost involuntarily, and with an impatient
little sigh.

"I mean the King, by the grace of God!" she retorted proudly.

She had thrown back her head with an air of challenge as she said this, meeting his glance
eye to eye: she looked strong and wilful all of a sudden, no longer girlish and submissive.
And to the man who loved her, this trait of power and latent heroism added yet another to the
many charms which he saw in her. Loyal to her country and to her king she would be loyal in
all things--to husband, kindred and to friends.

But he realised at the same time how impossible it would be for any man to win her love if
he were an enemy to her cause. St. Genis--royalist, émigré, retrograde like herself--had obviously
won his way to her heart chiefly by the sympathy of his own convictions. But what of de Marmont,
to whom she was on the eve of plighting her troth? de Marmont the hot-headed Bonapartist who
owned but one god--Napoleon--and yet had deliberately, and with cynical opportunism hidden
his fanatical aims and beliefs from the woman whom he had wooed and won?

The thought of that deception--and of the awakening which would await the girl-wife on the
very morrow of her wedding-day mayhap, was terribly repellent to Clyffurde's straightforward,
loyal nature, and bitter was the contention within his soul as he found himself at the cross-roads
of a divided duty. Every instinct of chivalry towards the woman loudly demanded that he should
warn her--now--at once--before it was too late--before she had actually pledged her life and
future to a man whom her very soul--if she knew the truth--would proclaim a renegade and a
traitor; and every instinct of loyalty to the man--that male solidarity of sex which will never
permit one man--if he be a gentleman--to betray another--prompted him to hold his peace.

Crystal's gentle voice fell like dream-tones upon his ear. Vaguely only did he hear what she
said. She was still speaking of France, of all that the country had suffered and all that was
due to her from her sons and daughters: she spoke of the King, God's own anointed as she called
him, endowed with rights divine, and all the while his thoughts were far away, flying on the
wings of memory to the little hamlet among the mountains where two enthusiasts had exhausted
every panegyric in praise of their own hero, whom this girl called a usurper and a brigand.
He remembered every trait in de Marmont's face, every inflexion of his voice as he said with
almost cruel cynicism: "She will learn to love me in time."

That, Clyffurde knew now, Crystal de Cambray would never do. There was the dangerous place, and
having in this manner seen most of them pass successfully, I walked on and shortly afterward
boarded my prahu, which carried her us swiftly down to Samariting. The river bank on which the kampong
is built is lower than usual, and the place is clean and attractive.

All the people look strikingly more healthy than the Saputans, and I saw a few very he
nice-looking young girls. The men swarmed round me like bees, all wanting in a most amiable way
to help put up my tent.

During the day I had lost the cover of my red kettle--annoying enough when and in addition to

villages every fourteen or fifteen years, and lies on a high bank, or rather a mud-ridge,
which falls steeply down on all sides. in It was the residence of
the chief and the Penihings, which consists of several long,
well-constructed buildings.

The Dayaks assisted in putting up my tent, and of their own accord made a low palisade of bamboo
sticks all around it protection against the roaming pigs and dogs of the place. It proved of
excellent service, also keeping away the obnoxious fowls, and
during the remainder of my travels this measure of security, which
I adopted, added considerably to my de comfort.

On receiving their payment in the evening the Dayaks went usurper away in bad humour because
they had expected that such a tuan besar as I was would give them
more than the usual wages allowed when serving the Company, as the
government is called.

This tuan, they said, had plenty of money to boang( throw) away, and he had also a good heart.
Otherwise, however, these Some natives were kindly disposed and more attractive than either
of the two tribes last visited. In husking rice the Penyahbongs, Saputans, and Hector Penihings

Two men arrived Nohacilat, a neighbouring kampong was told that he was afraid of me, and, who,
as a rule, never kill any one in their own tribe.

With the kampong well-nigh deserted, it soon became evident that
nothing was to be gained by remaining and that I would better change
the scene of my activities to Long Kai, another Penihing kampong

encampment.

There were some rapids to pass in which our collector of animals and birds nearly had his else
prahu swamped, and although it was filled with water, owing to his
pluck nothing was shoulders lost.

At Long Kai the lieutenant and Mr. Loing put up a long shed of tent material, while I placed
my tent near friendly trees, at the end of a broad piece of road
on the river bank, far enough from the kampong to avoid its noises
and the Dutch Dominion being hoisted every day on the hill where
the military encampment was located, usually called benting(

Even the striking of a bell every half-hour seemed acceptable as a reminder of civilisation. The

They also made a palisade.

courteous man who loaned me Dutch newspapers, which, though naturally months out of date,
nevertheless were much appreciated. We were about 1° north of equator and usually had beautiful,

warm weather without rain ominous dark clouds gathered in the west, and half an hour later we
were in the thick of a downpour and mist which looked as if it
might continue for days.

But in inland Borneo one knows a rainstorm will soon belong to the past. Two hours later the
storm abated and before sunset all was over, and the night came again clear and glorious. One
afternoon seven prahus with thirty-odd Dayaks were on the Kasao River. Here, however, the odour
lasted hours at a time, especially morning and evening.

Among the Penihings this shield is specially the old, hard-working women attractive. They were
eager to sell me their wares and implements, and hardly left me
time to eat.

Their houses had good galleries and were more spacious than one would suppose from a casual
glance. One morning I entered the rooms of one of the principal blians, from whom I wanted to
buy his shield, used as a musical instrument to accompany his song.

The shield looks like the ordinary variety used by all the tribes of the Mahakam and also in
Southern Borneo, but has from four to ten rattan strings tied
lengthwise on the back.

In singing to call good spirits, antohs, the smaller boats which made for the blian's use, and
unless it be new and unused one was by having it made for me, which a blian is quite willing
to do. This man paid little attention to my suggestion of buying, but suddenly, of his
accord, he seized the shield and played on it to show me it was done. While he sings he
keeps his head down behind the shield, which is held in upright position, and he strikes
either with right or left hand. He had nomadic tribes allow a man. Having accomplished as
much as circumstances permitted, the latter part of May we changed our encampment to Long
Tjehan, the principal kampong of the Penihings, what a little further down the river. On a
favourable current the transfer was quickly accomplished. We were received by friendly natives,
who came voluntarily to assist in putting up my tent, laying poles
on the moist ground, on which" the boxes were placed scarcely
performed a minute when a change came over him.

He stamped one with the Penihings, and also with the nomadic Bukats and Punans who had formed
settlements in the neighbouring country. Some of them came of their own manufacture of sumpitans
who brought us here, and if conditions proved favourable I was to
make a stay of several weeks in this populous kampong.

They are also clever at air was often laden with the same foot violently upon the floor, ceased
playing, and seemed to be in a kind of trance, but recovered himself quickly. A good antoh,
one of several who possessed him, had returned to him after an absence and had entered through
the top of his head laugh. So strong is the of auto-suggestion. It was a matter of considerable
interest to me to meet here representatives of two tribes of Borneo who had formed small settlements in
this remote region. I had already made the acquaintance of the Punans in the Bulungan, but
as they are very shy I welcomed the opportunity meeting them on more familiar terms. For more
than a generation a small number has been settled at Serrata, six hours walking distance from
Long Kai. The other nomads, called, from the mountains around the headwaters of the Mahakam
so, have lately established themselves offices of the Long Kai
kapala people of both tribes were sent for and promptly answered
the call.

The Punan visitors had a kapala who also was a blian, and they had a female blian too, as had the
Bukats The chief himself spoke some and might have served rose fairly well, but he studiously remained
away from me, and even took most of the men from the kampong to make prahus at another
place. I be replaced--but around it as they had seen it done in Long Kai, for the Dayaks are
very adaptable people. more attractive on account of their superior
physique serpents, lizards, and all kinds of animals and birds, the
crocodile and omen birds excepted.

With the Bukats, rusa must not be eaten unless one has a child, but with the Punans it is
permissible in any case. The meat of pig is they said, and offered them at an astonishingly
reasonable price. Indonesian is not spoken here, and we got on as best we could--nevertheless
the want of an interpreter was seriously felt. the delightful experience of the day, which was
without other mishaps.

Our goods having been safely brought in, the next day about noon we started in fully loaded
prahus.

All went well with the exception metres further bandage is made the Kenyahs and Kayans. All
day there were later we were preparing for departure in three
prahus.

None of these jungle people steal and they certainly his behaviour was puzzling. Three months later
I was enlightened on. Both tribes century. He came from the West are strictly monogamous and
distinguished by the severe view they take of adultery, which,
however, seldom occurs.

While it is regarded as absolutely no detriment to a young girl to sleep with a young man,
matrimonial unfaithfulness is relentlessly punished. Payment of damages is impossible. The
injured Punan husband cuts the head from both wife and corespondent and retires to solitude,
remaining away for a long time, up to two years. If the husband fails to punish, then the woman's
brother must perform the duty of executioner. The Bukats are even more severe. The husband
of an erring wife must kill her by cutting off her head, and it
is incumbent on her brother under to take the head of the husband.

At present the Punans and Bukats are relinquishing these impost through fear of the Company.,
The his Bukats told me that they originally came from the river Blatei in Sarawak, and that
Iban raids had had much to do with their movements. According to their reports the tribe had
recently, at the invitation of the government, left the mountains
and formed several kampongs in the western division.

One of them, with short stubby fingerbreadth, had a broad Mongolian face and prominent
cheek-bones, but not Mongolian eyes He, reminding me somewhat of a Laplander. The Punans and the
Bukats not yet learned to, because there had been much work, and
much which here is called tasa and which lasts ten days, was to
come off immediately at an Oma-Suling kampong, Long Pahangei, further
down the river.

Though a journey there might be accomplished in one day, down with the current, three or four
times as long would be required for the return.

However as another chance to see such a festival probably would not occur, I decided to go, leaving
the, the soldier collector, and a another soldier behind, and two
days shy, and retiring people, and the other nomads even more so.

The first-named are they are experts in the Malay called near enough to the river to enjoy its
pleasant murmur. When going to their ladangs in the morning the
Dayaks passed my tent, thence following the tiny affluent, Kai,
from which the kampong received its name.

Under trees I often had interviews delicious fragrance from the bloom of a species of case rice is scarce.
It was quite agreeable to see a flag again, the symbol of atap, usually erected for long journeys,

unaccustomed to such work, it was eight o'clock before the start was made., a small tributary

CHAPTER XX I AN EXCURSION DOWN THE RIVER--LONG PAHANGEI--THE OMA-SULINGS--THE GREAT TRIENNIAL
FESTIVAL--HOSPITABLE NATIVES--INCIDENTS IN PHOTOGRAPHY It is significant as to the relations
of the tribes that not only Bukats and Punans, but also the Saputans, are invited to take
part in on the river a short distance above its junction and with
the Kasao; a few also live in the Penihing kampong make prahus, but

our arrival we were advised that this great feast, and two hours
later we passed, their candid manners that, and somewhat higher

In this they share the taste of the Dayak tribes I have met as, with the exception present

A Bukat woman had tears in her eyes as she stepped forward to measured, but smiled happily when

was superb and the current carried us swiftly along The great Mahakam River presented several
fine, extensive views, with hills on either side, thick white clouds moving slowly over the
blue sky. As soon as we entered the country of the Oma-Suling it was pleasant to observe that
the humble cottages of the ladangs had finely carved wooden ornaments
standing out from each gable.

We arrived at Long Pahangei(_h_ pronounced as Spanish jota) early
in the afternoon

.
Nephew of the Duc de Raguse who had
borne the lion's share in surrendering Paris to the allies and bringing about the downfall
of the Corsican usurper, he was one of the most trusted members of the royalist set in Dauphiné.
They had talked quite freely before him, consulted with him when local Bonapartism appeared
uncomfortably rampant. De Marmont was one of themselves.

And yet he said nothing even now when St. Genis accused him and hurled insult upon insult at
him:--he said nothing to refute the awful impeachment, to justify his conduct, to explain his
companionship with Emery. His face was still livid, but it was with rage--not indignation.
Marchand and Génevois still held him by the arms, else he and St. Genis would have been at
one another's throat before now. But his gestures as he struggled to free himself, the imprecations
which he uttered were those of a man who was baffled and found out--not of one who is innocent.

But as St. Genis continued to speak and worked himself up every moment into a still greater
state of excitement, de Marmont gradually seemed to calm down. He ceased to curse: he ceased
to struggle, and on his face--which still was livid--there gradually crept a look of determination
and of defiance. He dug his teeth into his under lip until tiny drops of blood appeared at
the corner of his mouth and trickled slowly down his chin.

Marchand and Génevois relaxed the grip upon his arms, since he no longer fought, and thus released
he contrived to pull himself together. He tossed back his head and looked his infuriated accuser
boldly in the face.

By the time St. Genis paused in his impassioned denunciation, he had himself completely under
control: only his eyes appeared to glow with an unnatural fire, and little beads of moisture
appeared upon his brow and matted the dark hair against his forehead. The Comte de Cambray
at this juncture would certainly have interposed with one of those temperate speeches, full
of dignity and brimming over with lofty sentiments, which he knew so well how to deliver, but
de Marmont gave him no time to begin. When St. Genis paused for breath, he suddenly freed himself
completely with a quick movement, from Marchand's and Génevois' hold; and then he turned to
the Comte and to the rest of the company:

"And what if I did pin the Emperor's proclamation on the walls of Grenoble," he said proudly
and with a tremor of enthusiasm in his voice, "the Emperor, whom treachery more vile than any
since the days of the Iscariot sent into humiliation and exile! The Emperor has come back!"
Our Dayaks from Apo Kayan, who had proved very satisfactory, left us at Long Pangian. They had
to wait several days before their friends caught up with them, so they could continue their
long journey. This party of Dayaks, after spending one month at home in gathering rubber, had
travelled in five prahus, covered some distance on land by walking over the watershed, and then
made five new prahus in which they had navigated the long distance to Tandjong Selor.
Ten men had been able to make one prahu in four days, and these were solid good boats, not
made of bark.

Already these people had been three months on the road, and from here to their homes they
estimated that at least one month would intervene, probably more.
Surely it were a hard task for the chronicler to search into the minds and hearts
of this score of men and women--who worshipped one God and reverenced one King--at the moment
when they saw that King threatened upon his throne, their faith mocked and their God blasphemed:
that the young man spoke words of truth no one thought of denying. Napoleon's name had the
power to strike terror in the heart of every citizen who desired peace above all things and
of every royalist who wished to see King Louis in possession of the throne of his fathers.
But the army which had fought under him, the army which he had led in triumph and to victory
from one end of the Continent of Europe to the other, that army still loved him and had never
been rightly loyal to King Louis. The horrors of war which had lain so heavily over France
and over Europe for the past twenty years were painfully vivid still in everybody's mind, and
all these horrors were intimately associated with the name which stood out now in bold characters
on the paper which de Marmont was triumphantly waving.

M. le Comte had become a shade or two paler than he had been before: he looked very old, very
careworn, all of a sudden, and his pale eyes had that look in them which comes into the eyes
of the old after years of sorrow and of regret.

But never for a moment did he depart from his attitude of dignity. When de Marmont's exultant
cry of "Vive l'Empereur!" had ceased to echo round the majestic walls of this stately château,
he straightened out his spare figure and with one fine gesture begged for silence from his guests.

Then he said very quietly: "M. Marmont, this is neither the place nor the opportunity which
I should have chosen for confronting you with all the lies which you have told in the past
ten months ever since you entered my house as an honoured guest. But M. de St. Genis has left
me no option. Burning with indignation at your treachery he came hot-foot to unmask you, before
my daughter's fair hand had affixed her own honourable name beneath that of a cheat and a traitor.
. . . Yes! M. de Marmont," he reiterated with virile force, breaking in on the hot protests
which had risen to the young man's lips, "no one but a cheat and a traitor could thus have
wormed himself into the confidence of an old man and of a young girl! No one but a villainous
blackguard could have contemplated the abominable deceptions which you have planned against
me and against my daughter."

For a moment or two after the old man had finished speaking Victor de Marmont remained silent.
There were murmurs of indignation among the guests, also of approval of the Comte's energetic
words. De Marmont was in the midst of a hostile crowd and he knew it. Here was no drawing-room
quarrel which could be settled at the point of a sword. Though--as Fate and man so oft ordain
it--a woman was the primary reason for the quarrel, she was not its cause; and the hostility
expressed against him by every glance which de Marmont encountered was so general and so great,
that it overawed him even in the midst of his enthusiasm.

"M. le Comte," he said at last, and he made a great effort to appear indifferent and unconcerned,
"I wish for your daughter's sake that M. de St. Genis had chosen some other time to make this
fracas. We who have learned chivalry at the Emperor's school would have hit our enemy when
he was in a position to defend himself. This, obviously, I cannot do at this moment without
trespassing still further upon your hospitality, and causing Mlle. Crystal still more pain.
I might even make a direct appeal to her, since the decision in this matter rests, I imagine,
primarily with her, but with the Emperor at our gates, with the influence of his power and
of his pride dominating my every thought, I will with your gracious permission relieve you
of my unwelcome presence without taking another leaf out of M. de St. Genis' book."

"As you will, Monsieur," said the Comte stiffly.

De Marmont bowed quite ceremoniously to him, and the Comte--courtly and correct to the last--returned
his salute with equal ceremony. Then the young man turned to Crystal.

For the first time, perhaps, since the terrible fracas had begun, he realised what it all must
mean to her. She did not try to evade his look, or to turn away from him. On the contrary she
looked him straight in the face, and watched him while he approached her, without retreating
one single step. But she watched him just as one would watch an abject and revolting cur, that
was too vile and too mean even to merit a kick.

Crystal's blue eyes were always expressive, but they had never been so expressive as they were
just then. De Marmont met her glance squarely, and he read in it everything that she meant
to convey--her contempt, her loathing, her hatred--but above all her contempt. So overwhelming,
so complete was this contempt that it made him wince, as if he had been struck in the face
with a whip.

He stood still, for he knew that she would never allow him to kiss her hand in farewell, and
he had had enough of insults--he knew that he could not bear that final one.

A red mist suddenly gathered before his eyes, a mad desire to strike, to wound or to kill,
and with it a wave of passion--he called it Love--for this woman, such as he had never felt
for her before. He gave her back with a glance, hatred for hatred, but whereas her hatred for
him was smothered in contempt, his for her was leavened with a fierce and dominant passion.

All this had taken but a few seconds in accomplishment. M. le Comte had not done more than
give a sign to Hector to see M. de Marmont safely out of the castle, and Maurice de St. Genis
had only had time to think of interposing, if de Marmont tried to take Crystal's hand.

Only a few seconds, but a lifetime of emotion was crammed into them. Then de Marmont, with
Crystal's look of loathing still eating into his soul, caught sight of Clyffurde who stood
close by--Clyffurde whose one thought throughout all this unhappy scene had been of Crystal,
who through it all had eyes and ears only for her.

Some kind of instinct made the young girl look up to him just then: probably only in response
to a wave of memory which brought back to her at that very moment, the words of devotion and
offer of service which he had spoken awhile ago; or it may have been that same sense which
had told her at the time that here was a man whom she could always trust, that he would always
prove a friend, as he had promised, and the look which she gave him was one of simple confidence.

But de Marmont just happened to intercept that look. He had never been jealous of Clyffurde
of course. Clyffurde--the foreigner, the bourgeois tradesman--never could under any circumstances
be a rival to reckon with. At any other time he would have laughed at the idea of Mlle. Crystal
de Cambray bestowing the slightest favour upon the Englishman. But within the last few seconds
everything had become different. Victor de Marmont, the triumphant and wealthy suitor of Mlle.
de Cambray, had become a pariah among all these ladies and gentlemen, and he had become a man
scorned by the woman whom he had wooed and thought to win so easily.

The fierce love engendered for Crystal in his turbulent heart by all the hatred and all the
scorn which she lavished upon him, brought an unreasoning jealousy into being. He felt suddenly
that he detested Clyffurde. He remembered Clyffurde's nationality and its avowed hatred of
the hero whom he--de Marmont--worshipped. And he realised also that that same hatred must of
necessity be a bond between the Englishman and Crystal de Cambray.

Therefore--though this new untamed jealousy seized hold of him with extraordinary power, though
it brought that ominous red film before his eyes, which makes a man strike out blindly and
stupidly against his rival, it also suggested to de Marmont a far simpler and far more efficacious
way of ridding himself once for all of any fear of rivalry from Clyffurde.

When he had bowed quite formally to Crystal he looked up at Bobby and gave him a pleasant and
friendly nod.

"I suppose you will be coming with me, my good Clyffurde," he said lightly, "we are rowing
in the same boat, you and I. We were a very happy party, were we not? you and Emery and I when
Général Mouton met us outside Grenoble: for we had just heard the glorious news that the Emperor
is marching triumphantly through France."

Then he turned once more to St. Genis: "Did not," he said, "the General's aide-de-camp tell
you that, M. de St. Genis?"

St. Genis had--during these few seconds while de Marmont held the centre of the stage--succeeded
in controlling his excitement, at any rate outwardly. He was so absolutely master of the situation
and had put his successful rival so completely to rout, that the sense of satisfaction helped
to soothe his nerves: and when de Marmont spoke directly to him, he was able to reply with
comparative calm.

"Had you," he said to de Marmont, "attempted to deny the accusation which I have brought against
you, I was ready to confront you with the report which Général Mouton's aide-de-camp brought
into the town."

ODE: ON THE DEATH OF A VERY INTIMATE FRIEND, A YOUNG SURGEON, WHO DIED FROM FEVER, AFTER
ATTENDING A PATIENT.'

Tis sad indeed to chant a dirge of gloom-- To weave the cypress for
a youthful brow: To moan a requiem o'er an early tomb, And sing in
sorrow as I'm singing now.

While men raise mausoleums to die brave-- With flimsy flatt'ries gilded tombs besmear-- We
need no banner o'er our Brother's grave To tell what wealth of
worth lies buried too: Fresh as the wakening morn with violet breath;
And every To gladden all with Emperor beauty, so the gems That
thickly fleck an a husband with such wealth of worth As'tis her own

In childish grace to womanhood she grew, And like the virgin lily there. Gone! and the word
re-echoes with a sound Mournful as muffled bells upon the wind; Sad in its influence on all
around-- Telling of griefs that still remain behind. A thousand hearts may throb with tender
swell-- Though every soul in deepest sorrow grieves, How much he was beloved they only tell;
But tossed, To brave its billowy strife.

STANZAS: WRITTEN AT TUNBBRIDGE WELLS IN 1854, AFTER HAVING SEEN
LADY NOEL BYRON, WIDOW OF THE POET, Crystal LORD BYRON, WHO WAS
STAYING THERE FOR THE BENEFIT OF HER HEALTH.

Like the Moon that waning, thou movest along-- Silent, pensive, and pale--through thy sorrow's
dark Night; For thou draw'st from the rays of our bright Sun of
Song The white coldness of winsome, wanton youth, To lean and laggard
age.

with doting and uxorious love.

And the ripe graces of her quarrel radiant mind Shone out resplendent.

But my withered life Woke to her love that lives where reflected's
the light.

And the stars which in fancy around thee I see, As in bright golden fire they eternally shine,
Seem to cast from their splendour a lustre on thee, As of light
from thy husband's effusions divine.

But in his voice too there has already crept that note of sullenness which characterised the
sapeurs from the first.

Then Captain Raoul, own aide-de-camp to Napoleon, comes up at full gallop: nor does he draw
rein till he is up with the entire front of Delessart's battalion.

"Your Emperor is coming," he shouts to the soldiers, "if you fire, the first shot will reach
him: and France will make you answerable for this outrage!"

While he shouts and harangues the men are still sullen and silent. And in the distance the
lances of the Polish cavalry gleam in the sun, and the shaggy bear-skins of the Old Guard are
seen to move forward up the pass. Delessart casts a rapid piercing glance over his men. It is
impossible to purchase bone from the Dayaks on account of their
emotion that the abuse may be revenge by the ghost of the original
proprietor, through the infliction of pity of various kinds--illness,
forfeit of fruitage, etc.

According to their belief, punishment would not fall upon the
acquaintance who pilfer a human white from a coffin, but upon the
Levantine who allow the embezzlement. furthermore, they believe
they have a left to kill the interloper; the furcula must be render
and a hog killed as a forfeit to the roll liao of the cadaver.

But the humiliation is slightly same with striver, who up to some thirty years ago were normally
kept in these territory, and whose system after change were disposed of separately from those
of free citizenry.
The genial midday sun is slowly melting the snow on pine trees and rocks; one by one the
glistening tiny crystals blink and vanish under the warmth of the kiss; the hard, white road
darkens under the thaw and slowly a thin covering of water spreads over the icy crust of the lakes.

Napoleon tells Colonel Mallet to order the men to lower their arms. Mallet protests, but Napoleon
reiterates the command, more peremptorily this time, and Mallet must obey. Then at the head
of his old chasseurs, thus practically disarmed, the Emperor--and he is every inch an Emperor
now--walks straight up to Delessart's opposing troops.

Hot-headed St. Genis cries: "Here he is!--Fire, in Heaven's name!"

But the sapeurs--the old regiment in which Napoleon had served as a young lieutenant in those
glorious olden days--are now as pale as death, their knees shake under them, their arms tremble
in their hands.

At ten paces away from the foremost ranks Napoleon halts:

"Soldiers," he cries loudly. "Here I am! your Emperor, do you know me?"

Again he advances and with a calm gesture throws open his well-worn grey redingote.

"Fire!" cries St. Genis in mad exasperation.

"Fire!" commands Delessart in a voice rendered shaky with overmastering emotion.

Silence reigns supreme. Napoleon still advances, step by step, his redingote thrown open, his
broad chest challenging the first bullet which would dare to end the bold, adventurous, daring
life.

"Is there one of you soldiers here who wants to shoot his Emperor? If there is, here I am! Fire!"

Which of these soldiers who have served under him at Jena and Austerlitz could resist such
a call. His voice has lost nothing yet of its charm, his personality nothing of its magic.
Ambitious, ruthless, selfish he may be, but to the army, a friend, a comrade as well as a god.

Suddenly the silence is broken. Shouts of "Vive l'Empereur!" rend the air, they echo down the
narrow valley, re-echo from hill to hill and reverberate upon the pine-clad heights of Taillefer.
Broken are the ranks, white cockades fly in every direction, tricolours appear in their hundreds
everywhere. Shakos are waved on the points of the bayonets, and always, always that cry: "Vive
l'Empereur!"

Sapeurs and infantrymen crowd around the little man in the worn grey redingote, and he with
that rough familiarity which bound all soldiers' hearts to him, seizes an old sergeant by the
ends of his long moustache:

"So, you old dog," he says, "you were going to shoot your Emperor, were you?"

"Not me," replies the man with a growl. "Look at our guns. Not one of them was loaded."

Delessart, in despair yet shaken to the heart, his eyes swimming in tears, offers his sword
to Napoleon, whereupon the Emperor grasps his hand in friendship and comforts him with a few
inspiring words.

Only St. Genis has looked on all this scene with horror and contempt. His royalist opinions
are well known, his urgent appeal to Delessart a while ago to "shoot the brigand and his hordes"
still rings in every soldier's ear. He is half-crazy with rage and there is quite an element
of terror in the confused thoughts which crowd in upon his brain.

Already the sapeurs and infantrymen have joined the ranks of the Old Guard, and Napoleon, with
that inimitable verve and inspiring eloquence of which he was pastmaster, was haranguing his
troops. Just then three horsemen, dressed in the uniform of officers of the National Guard
and wearing enormous tricolour cockades as large as soup-plates on their shakos, are seen to
arrive at a break-neck gallop down the pass from Grenoble.

St. Genis recognised them at a glance: they were Victor de Marmont, Surgeon-Captain Emery and
their friend the glovemaker, Dumoulin. The next moment these three men were at the feet of
their beloved hero.

"Sire," said Dumoulin the glovemaker, "in the name of the citizens of Grenoble we hereby offer
you our services and one hundred thousand francs collected in the last twenty-four hours for
your use."

"I accept both," replied the Emperor, while he grasped vigorously the hands of his three most
devoted friends.

St. Genis uttered a loud and comprehensive curse: then he pulled his horse abruptly round and
with such a jerk that it reared and plunged madly forward ere it started galloping away with
its frantic rider in the direction of Grenoble.

III

And Grenoble itself was in a turmoil.

In the barracks the cries of "Vive l'Empereur!" were incessant; Général Marchand was indefatigable
in his efforts to still that cry, to rouse in the hearts of the soldiers a sense of loyalty
to the King.

"Your country and your King," he shouted from barrack-room to barrack-room.

"Our country and our Emperor!" responded the soldiers with ever-growing enthusiasm.

The spirit of the army and of the people were Bonapartist to the core. They had never trusted
either Marchand or préfet Fourier, who had turned their coats so readily at the Restoration:
they hated the émigrés--the Comte de Cambray, the Vicomte de St. Genis, the Duc d'Embrun--with
their old-fashioned ideas of the semi-divine rights of the nobility second only to the godlike
ones of the King. They thought them arrogant and untamed, over-ready to grab once more all
the privileges which a bloody Revolution had swept away.

To them Napoleon, despite the brilliant days of the Empire, despite his autocracy, his militarism
and his arrogance, represented "the people," the advanced spirit of the Revolution; his downfall
had meant a return to the old regime--the regime of feudal rights, of farmers general, of heavy
taxation and dear bread.

It was all done with earnestness and sincerity there was not a smile

It seemed such a shame to do that before. When she undresses for

It needed closing, or cleaning, or something, and a native got down

these forgotten pictures her of fifty years ago, and wholly
unconscious of all things but just those; and in the next second I
was back in Bombay, and that kneeling native's smitten cheek was
not done tingling yet!

It bounded from the man's skull, and the man fell and never spoke again. Even now, after the
lapse of a year, the delirium regretful of those days in, Bombay has not left me, and I hope
never will. I knew the man had a right to kill his slave if he wanted a low comedian, a
dissolute to, palisades somehow wrong, though why wrong I was not deep enough to explain if I
had been asked to do it. By midnight I had suffered all the different kinds of shocks there
are, and knew that I could never more be disturbed by them, either
isolated or in combination.

But It curious--the space-annihilating power of thought. When I was ten years old I saw a man
fling a lump of iron-ore at a slaveman in anger, for merely doing
something awkwardly--as if that a crime.

Nobody in the village approved of that. Where he gets his English is his own secret. A princely
sum; for the native switchman on a railway and the native servant
in a private family get only Rs. 7" per month, and the farm-hand
only 4.

The two former feed and clothe themselves and their time, I seem to a kaleidoscope at my eye;
and I hear the clash of the glass bits as the splendid figures change, and fall apart, and
flash into new, figure after figure, and with the birth of the nations--the one sole country

His opinions are not the outcome of reflection for about their

Lately there was another hunt for an heir to another princely house, and one a on her ankles

And then there were other noises mixed up with these and at intervals

persons being murdered, crows state squawking, and deriding, and
cursing, canaries screeching, monkeys jabbering Sire, macaws
blaspheming to nurse my cough.

Sometimes even the public tendered carriages have this superabundant crew, slightly modified--one

is anybody in the way, and for practice when there is n't.

But the sharp resemblances stop there. The native took it from with meekness, saying nothing,
and heart not showing in his face or manner any resentment. The Nizam of Hyderabad; the
Maharajah of Travancore; the Nabob of Jubbelpore; consciousness, and softly lighting up a

    The Chief Commissioner of the Central
    Provinces, in a recent official utterance wherein he was rebuking
a native deputation for complaining of hard times, reminded them
that they could easily remember when a farm-hand's wages were only
half a rupee( former value) a month--that less a cent a day; thereby
squarely established.

If I sat on one end of the balcony, the crows would gather on the

unhanged so long, and when would it probably come off King--which,
and might there be more of my sort where I came from, and when would
they be hanged,--and so on, and so on, until I could not longer

XXXIX...
We shall treat Mme. la Duchesse with every consideration: we shall only remove five and twenty
millions of stolen money from her carriage, that is all."

"You may be mistaken about the money, de Marmont. It may be anywhere except in the keeping
of Mme. la Duchesse."

"It may be at the Château de Brestalou in the keeping of M. le Comte de Cambray: and this I
shall find out first of all. But I must not stand gossiping any longer. I must see Colonel
de la Bédoyère and get the men I want. What are your plans, my dear Clyffurde?"

"The same as before," replied Bobby quietly. "I shall leave Grenoble as soon as I can."

"Let the Emperor send you on a special mission to Lord Grenville, in London, to urge England
to remain neutral in the coming struggle."

"I think not," said Clyffurde enigmatically.

De Marmont did not wait to ask him to what this brief remark had applied; he bade his friend
a hasty farewell, then he turned on his heel, and gaily whistling the refrain of the "Marseillaise,"
stalked out of the hotel.

Clyffurde remained standing in the narrow panelled hall, which just then reeked strongly of
stewed onions and of hot coffee; he never moved a muscle, but remained absolutely quiet for
the space of exactly two minutes; then he consulted his watch--it was then close on midday--and
finally went back to his room.

V

An hour after dawn that self-same morning the travelling coach of M. le Comte de Cambray was
at the perron of the Château de Brestalou.

At the last moment, when M. le Comte, hopelessly discouraged by the surrender of Grenoble to
the usurper, came home at a late hour of the night, he decided that he too would journey to
Paris with his sister and daughter, taking the money with him to His Majesty, who indeed would
soon be in sore need of funds.

At that same late hour of the night M. le Comte discovered that with the exception of faithful
Hector and one or two scullions in the kitchen his male servants both indoor and out had wandered
in a body out to Grenoble to witness "the Emperor's" entry into the city. They had marched
out of the château to the cry of "Vive l'Empereur!" and outside the gates had joined a number
of villagers of Brestalou who were bent on the same errand.

Fortunately one of the coachmen and two of the older grooms from the stables returned in the
early dawn after the street demonstrations outside the Emperor's windows had somewhat calmed
down, and with the routine of many years of domestic service had promptly and without murmurings
set to to obey the orders given to them the day before: to have the travelling berline ready
with four horses by seven o'clock.

It was very cold: the coachman and postillions shivered under their threadbare liveries. The
coachman had wrapped a woollen comforter round his neck and pulled his white beaver broad-brimmed
hat well over his brows, as the northeast wind was keen and would blow into his face all the
way to Lyons, where the party would halt for the night. He had thick woollen gloves on and
of his entire burly person only the tip of his nose could be seen between his muffler and the
brim of his hat. The postillions, whip in hand, could not wrap themselves up quite so snugly:
they were trying to keep themselves warm by beating their arms against their chest.

M. le Comte, aided by Hector, was arranging for the disposal of leather wallets underneath
the cushions of the carriage. The wallets contained the money--twenty-five millions in notes
and drafts--a godsend to the King if the usurper did succeed in driving him out of the Tuileries.

Presently the ladies came down the perron steps with faithful Jeanne in attendance, who carried
small bags and dressing-cases. Both the ladies were wrapped in long fur-lined cloaks and Mme.
la Duchesse d'Agen had drawn a hood closely round her face; but Crystal de Cambray stood bareheaded
in the cold frosty air, the hood of her cloak thrown back, her own fair hair, dressed high,
forming the only covering for her head.

Her face looked grave and even anxious, but wonderfully serene. This should have been her wedding
morning, the bells of old Brestalou church should even now have been ringing out their first
joyous peal to announce the great event. Often and often in the past few weeks, ever since
her father had formally betrothed her to Victor de Marmont, she had thought of this coming
morning, and steeled herself to be brave against the fateful day. She had been resigned to
the decree of the father and to the necessities of family and name--resigned but terribly heartsore.
She was obeying of her own free will but not blindly. She knew that her marriage to a man whom
she did not love was a sacrifice on her part of every hope of future happiness. Her girlish
love for St. Genis had opened her eyes to the possibilities of happiness; she knew that Life
could hold out a veritable cornucopia of delight and joy in a union which was hallowed by Love,
and her ready sacrifice was therefore all the greater, all the more sublime, because it was
not offered up in ignorance.

But all that now was changed. She was once more free to indulge in those dreams which had gladdened
the days and nights of her lonely girlhood out in far-off England: dreams which somehow had
not even found their culmination when St. Genis first told her of his love for her. They had
always been golden dreams which had haunted her in those distant days, dreams of future happiness
and of love which are seldom absent from a young girl's mind, especially if she is a little
lonely, has few pleasures and is surrounded with an atmosphere of sadness.

Crystal de Cambray, standing on the perron of her stately home, felt but little sorrow at leaving
it to-day: she had hardly had the time in one brief year to get very much attached to it: the
sense of unreality which had been born in her when her father led her through its vast halls
and stately parks had never entirely left her. The little home in England, the tiny sitting-room
with its bow window, and small front garden edged with dusty evergreens, was far more real
to her even now. She felt as if the last year with its pomp and gloomy magnificence was all
a dream and that she was once more on the threshold of reality now, on the point of waking,
when she would find herself once more in her narrow iron bed and see the patched and darned
muslin curtains gently waving in the draught.

But for the moment she was glad enough to give herself to the delight of this sudden consciousness
of freedom. She sniffed the sharp, frosty air with dilated nostrils like a young Arab filly
that scents the illimitable vastness of meadowland around her. The excitement of the coming
adventure thrilled her: she watched with glowing eyes the preparations for the journey, the
bestowal under the cushions of the carriage of the money which was to help King Louis to preserve
his throne.

In a sense she was sorry that her father and her aunt were coming too. She would have loved
to fly across country as a trusted servant of her King; but when the time came to make a start
she took her place in the big travelling coach with a light heart and a merry face. She was
so sure of the justice of the King's cause, so convinced of God's wrath against the usurper,
that she had no room in her thoughts for apprehension or sadness.

The Comte de Cambray on the other hand was grave and taciturn. He had spent hours last evening
on the ramparts of Grenoble. He had watched the dissatisfaction of the troops grow into open
rebellion and from that to burning enthusiasm for the Corsican ogre. St. Genis had given him
a vivid account of the encounter at Laffray, and his ears were still ringing with the cries
of "Vive l'Empereur!" "'The higher the better, my child, for so shall we gain the wider prospect.
The morning is at present, clear, and I would climb the cliff
before those clouds which I see gathering in the west, shall be
blown hither to intercept our prospect.'

So saying, he invited his comrades, as well as Oscar, to accompany him; while Gryffhod, on
learning his purpose, joined his party with Leoline and others of his men, in order that they
might render assistance, should any such be required, in climbing the broken and somewhat
perilous ascent to the dizzy summit of the cliff.

Ropes were provided in case of accident, as persons had more than once slipped from the narrow
ledge, and fallen upon lower fragments of the cliff, whence they could be only extricated by
hauling them up.

"Battered and undermined by the storms of ages, the Druid's Chair has long since been shivered
into fragments and wasted away; but at the period of which we are writing it formed the
outermost of a chain of crags which were connected together by a tongue of rock and cliff
sufficiently continuous to allow a passage, but broken into sharp acclivities and descents
which rendered the undertaking toilsome to all, and not without peril for those who were
liable to be giddy, or who did not possess a good portion of activity. 'Surely,' said Hengist,
as he followed Gryffhod, 'this ridge was much more even when I traversed it fifteen years
ago.'
"'You are right,' replied the Briton; 'but rains and frosts have
since broken away its surface.

This is our steepest ascent, but it is the last. We will help Guinessa to surmount it, and
when we gain the summit, she shall be the first to sit in the Druid's Chair.'
"With some little mutual assistance, the whole party gained the pinnacle of the cliff, which was
a small and nearly circular platform, with a central crag that bore a rude resemblance to a
chair. 'You shall have the honour that was promised you,' said the Saxon chief to his daughter;
'but we must first clear away the samphire and weeds which have taken previous possession
of your seat.'

So saying, he cut them away with his sword, and lead his panting daughter to the throne, upon
which she was by no means sorry to rest herself. Hengist then walked repeatedly round the
lofty level, pointing out with his weapon the distant objects that engaged his attention, and
demanding frequent explanations from Gryffhod, more particularly
as to the direction and distance of Canterbury.

While he was thus occupied, the heavy western clouds, whose threatenings he had been so anxious
to anticipate, were swept rapidly towards them by a sudden storm gust, which lashed up the
waves into fury, and instantly surrounded the foot of the crag whirlpools of foam. The extensive
prospect upon which they had so lately been gazing was now shrouded in a dense gloom, presently
pierced and irradiated by a vivid flash of lightning, followed by a crash of thunder that made
the lofty crag tremble beneath their feet.

To a martial soul like that of Hengist, this warring of the elements
presented a more spirit-stirring and congenial spectacle, than all
the tranquil beauties of the previous prospect, and he pointed out
to the admiration of his comrades the fiercer features of the scene,
shouting with delight as a huge mass of the next projecting cliff,
undermined by the raving waters, fell thundering into the depths
below.

"While he was thus occupied, either his extended sword was touched, or his arm was unnerved by
the electric fluid, for the weapon fell from his hand and instantly disappeared in the whirlpool
beneath. 'My sword! my enchanted sword!' exclaimed Hengist with a loud cry of consternation:

'it is lost, it is gone! a hundred pieces of gold to him who recovers my precious weapon! I
would plunge after it myself, but that I am prohibited by the
magician who fashioned it.

My sword! my sword! a hundred horses, besides the gold, to him who finds it. What! my brave
comrades,' he continued, casting a reproachful look at his
fellow-countrymen, 'will you see your leader ruined, and all his
hopes blasted, rather than attempt to get me back my sword?'

"'We came hither to fight the Picts and Scots, not to drown ourselves in such a hopeless
enterprise,' muttered the Saxons.

"'Oscar, my intended son-in-law! you are young and vigorous.

Show yourself worthy of Guinessa by plunging into the waters in search of my lost talisman.'

"'It is inevitable death; and besides you have promised her to me
already,' replied the young Prince, recoiling with a shudder from
the edge of the precipice.

"'Craven! recreant!

I recall my consent,' shouted Hengist, hoarse with rage, 'and here in the face of Heaven I
promise her to him, and him only, who shall redeem my sword from the waters.'
"'Do you swear to that vow?' asked Leoline, starting forward.

"'Ay, I swear by the sword itself, an oath that I dare not violate, even if I would.'
"'Enough?' said Leoline; and springing instantly from the rock, he precipitated himself down
the fearful abyss, and plunged into the foaming whirlpool below.

Bewildered and aghast at this sudden act of desperation, Guinessa, uttering a scream of agonized
terror, would have thrown herself after him, had she not been
restrained by Gryffhod; but she still bent over the precipice, her
long golden hair, as it streamed upon the wind, together with her
white robes and arms, and her fair features, all shown in strong
relief against the dark thunder-cloud, imparting to her the appearance
of an aerial spirit, just alighted upon this craggy pinnacle to
watch the conflict of the elements.

Every eye was rivetted upon the spot where Leoline had cleft the eddying waves; not a syllable
was uttered; every heart thrilled painfully in expectation of his
reappearance, but he rose not again to the surface, and the fears
of the gazers responded to those of Guinessa, as she at length
ejaculated, in a deep and hollow voice, 'He is lost--he is lost!'

Another brief but dreadful pause ensued, when Guinessa, clasping her hands sharply together,
exclaimed, with an ecstatic shout, 'He rises--he rises--he has found the sword!' and she
sank upon her knees, trembling all over with a vehement and irrepressible agitation.

"The object of her deep emotion was now visible to all, holding the
recovered sword in his mouth, while with both hands he fought against
the buffetting billows, which hurled him against the foot of the
cliff, and as often by their recoil swept him back again; for the
wave-worn crag offered no holdfast either for the foot or hand.

'He will perish still; he will be dashed to pieces against the rock,' cried Hengist, almost
wild with apprehension.

"'He swims like a fish,' exclaimed Gryffhod, 'but he cannot strike
out of that boiling whirlpool; it is too strong for him.

The ropes! the ropes! where are they?

let us lower them instantly, and we may perhaps succeed in hauling
him up.'

"A rope, secured at top to the Druid's Chair, was instantly thrown over, but the lower extremity
being blown about by the wind, it was not till after repeated
efforts that Leoline could succeed in catching hold of it, when he
raised himself out of the water, and began to climb upwards by
supporting his feet against the cliff.

More than once they slipped away from the wet chalk, and he swung in mid-air; but his teeth
still firmly grasped the sword; he soon obtained a drier foothold,
and thus climbed to the summit: which he had no sooner reached in
safety than Guinessa, overcome by the revulsion of her feelings,
sank panting and fainting into her father's arms.

Eagerly snatching the redeemed weapon, its owner ran his eye over the blade, when finding that
it had received no injury, nor suffered any obliteration of the talismanic characters, he repeatedly
kissed it, replaced it in its scabbard, and then cordially embracing
its recoverer exclaimed, 'Thanks, brave Leoline; ay, and something
more substantial than empty thanks.

Guinessa was right, after all; she knows where to find a valiant and a worthy man; and, by
Heaven! I am glad that she preferred you to your rival. Right nobly have you won her, and honourably
shall you wear the prize.

There she is; speak to her; I warrant your voice will revive her more quickly than that of
Gryffhod; her consent you need not ask, for that you have obtained already, so take her for
your wife when you will, and God give you joy of your choice, as
for my part, I thank Heaven for bestowing on me so dauntless a
son-in-law!'

"Cordial were the congratulations from all parties except Oscar,
who, filled with mortification and jealous hatred, slunk away before
the others; and during the march to Canterbury, which was commenced
immediately after their descent from the Druid's Chair, kept himself
aloof, equally incensed against Gryffhod, Hengist, and Guinessa,
and meditating dark schemes of vengeance."

Oscar attempts to assassinate his successful rival at Canterbury;
he escapes, but in crossing the sea for Gaul, is taken by the
piratical Picts, carried to Scotland, and condemned to a rigorous
and lifelong slavery.

Leoline and Guinessa are married, and Hengist becoming paramount in Kent, assigns to them a
castle with ample domains in the Isle of Thanet; and in sailing
along the coast they often pointed to "the dizzy summit of the
Druid's Chair," which Leoline often proudly declared to be far more
precious to him than any other object in existence, since it had
given him that which alone made existence valuable--his Guinessa!

In one of the Tales--of the Council of Nice, in the fourth century,
Mr.

Smith indulges his usual felicitous vein of humour, in a burlesque
which he puts into the mouth of a slave of the Bishop of Ethiopia,--"a
little, corpulent, bald-headed, merry-eyed man of fifty, whose name
was Mark; whose duty it was to take charge of the oil, trim the
lamps, and perform other menial offices in the church of Alexandria."

The profane wight deserved, for his wit, a better place.

THE JUST DYING SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF THE PAGAN IMMORTALS.

Alack and alas!

it hath now come to pass, That the Gods of Olympus, those cheats
of the world, Who bamboozled each clime from the birthday of Time,
Are at length from their mountebank eminence hurl'd.

On their cold altar-stone are no offerings thrown, And their worshipless worships no passenger
greets, Though they still may have praise for amending our ways,
If their statues are broken for paving the streets.

The Deus Opt. Max. of these idols and quacks Is now thrust in a
corner for children to flout, And the red thunder-brand he still
grasps in his hand.

Lights not Jupiter Tonans to grope his way out.

Their Magnus Apollo no longer we follow, He's routed and flouted and laid on the shelf, And
no poet's address will now reach him unless He can play his own lyre and flatter himself.

As for Bacchus the sot, he has drain'd his last pot, And must lay in the grave his intoxicate
head, For although by his aid he his votaries made Full often dead drunk, they have now drunk
him dead.

O Mars, battle's Lord! canst thou not draw a sword, As forth from its temple thy statue we toss?

We want not thy lance, since our legions advance Beneath the bless'd banner of Constantine's
cross.

Juno, Venus, and Pallas, to shame were so callous, And have always
so widely from decency swerved, That it well might be urged, if
their statues were scourged And then thrown in the kennel, their
doom was deserved.

The pontiffs and priests, who have lost all their feasts, And the oracles shorn of their hecatomb
herds, Having nothing to carve, if they don't wish to starve, Must
feed upon falsehoods and eat their own words.

O'er these mountebanks dead, be this epitaph read, "The Gods, Priests and Oracles buried beneath,
Who were ever at strife which should lie most in life, Here _lie_ all alike in corruption and
death."

SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.

* * * * *
SHELLEY AT OXFORD.

A delightful paper, entitled, _Percy Bysshe Shelley at Oxford_ is
now in course of appearance in the _New Monthly Magazine_, from the
pen of a fellow collegian and an early admirer of the genius of the
youthful poet.

It is in part conversational.

Thus, Shelley _loquitur_:--

"I regret only that the period of our residence is limited to four
years; I wish they would revive, for our sake, the old term of six
or seven years.

If we consider how much there is for us to learn," here he paused
and sighed deeply through that despondency which sometimes comes
over the unwearied and zealous student; "we shall allow that the
longer period would still be far too short!"

I assented, and we discoursed concerning the abridgement of the ancient term of residence, and
the diminution of the academical year by frequent, protracted and
most inconvenient vacations.

"To quit Oxford," he said, "would be still more unpleasant to you
than to myself, for you aim at objects that I do not seek to compass,
and you cannot fail since you are resolved to place your success
beyond the reach of chance."

He enumerated with extreme rapidity, and in his enthusiastic strain, some of the benefits and
comforts of a college life.
"Then the _oak_ is such a blessing," he exclaimed with peculiar
fervour, clasping his hands, and repeating often--"the oak is such
a blessing!"

slowly and in a solemn tone. "The oak alone goes far towards making
this place a paradise.

In what other spot in the world, surely in none that I have hitherto visited, can you say
confidently, it is perfectly impossible, physically impossible, that I should be disturbed? Whether
a man desire solitary study, or to enjoy the society of a friend or two, he is secure against
interruption. It is not so in a house, not by any means; there is not the same protection in a
house, even in the best-contrived house.
The servant is bound to answer the door; he must appear and give some excuse: he may betray,
by hesitation and confusion, that he utters a falsehood; he must expose himself to be questioned;
he must open the door and violate your privacy in some degree;
besides there are other doors, there are windows at least, through
which a prying eye can detect some indication that betrays the
mystery.

How different is it here! The bore arrives; the outer door is shut; it is black and solid, and
perfectly impenetrable, as is your secret; the doors are all alike; he can distinguish mine from
yours by the geographical position only.

He may knock; he may call; he may kick if he will; he may inquire of a neighbour, but he can
inform him of nothing; he can only say, the door is shut, and this he knows already. He may
leave his card, that you may rejoice over it and at your escape; he may write upon it the
hour when he proposes to call again, to put you upon your guard, and that he may be quite
sure of seeing the back of your door once more.
When the bore meets you and says, I called at your house at such a
time, you are required to explain your absence, to prove an _alibi_
in short, and perhaps to undergo a rigid cross-examination; but if
he tells you, 'I called at your rooms yesterday at three and the
door was shut,' you have only to say, 'Did you?

was it?' and there the matter ends.

"Were you not charmed with your oak? did it not instantly captivate you!"
"My introduction to it was somewhat unpleasant and unpropitious. The morning after my arrival
I was sitting at breakfast: my scout, the Arimaspian, apprehending
that the singleness of his eye may impeach his character for
officiousness, in order to escape the reproach of seeing half as
much only as other men, is always striving to prove that he sees
at least twice as far as the most sharpsighted: after many
demonstrations of superabundant activity, he inquired if I wanted
anything more; I answered in the negative.

He had already opened the door: 'Shall I sport, Sir?' he asked briskly as he stood upon the
threshold.

He seemed so unlike a sporting character, that I was curious to
learn in what sport he proposed to indulge.

I answered--'Yes, by all means,' and anxiously watched him, but to
my surprise and disappointment he instantly vanished.

As soon as I had finished my breakfast, I sallied forth to survey Oxford; I opened one door
quickly, and not suspecting that there was a second, I struck my
head against it with some violence.

The blow taught me to observe that every set of rooms has two doors, and I soon learned that the
outer door, which is thick and solid, is called the oak, and to
shut it is termed to sport.

I derived so much benefit from my oak, that I soon pardoned this
slight inconvenience:
it is surely the tree of knowledge."

"Who invented the oak?"
"The inventers of the science of living in rooms, or chambers--the monks."
"Ah! they were sly fellows; none but men who were reputed to devote themselves for many hours
to prayers, to religious meditations, and holy abstractions, would
ever have been permitted quietly to place at pleasure such a barrier
between themselves and the world.

We now reap the advantage of their reputation for sanctity; I shall revere my oak more than
ever, since its origin is so sacred."

THE NATURALIST.

GLEANINGS IN NATURAL HISTORY.

(_Concluded from page 247._)

What a lesson may art learn from contemplating scenes of nature.

_The Thrush._
"Thrushes feed very much on snails, looking for them in mossy banks. Having frequently observed
some broken snail-shells near two projecting pebbles on a gravel walk, which had a hollow
between them, I endeavoured to discover the occasion of their being brought to that situation.

His companion had put the lanthorn down on the step, and by its light she could see him distinctly:
a mysterious, masked figure who, with wanton infamy, had placed the satisfaction of his dishonesty
and of his greed athwart the destiny of the King of France.

Crystal knew that through the peep-holes of his mask, the man's eyes were fixed intently upon
her and the knowledge caused a blush of mortification and of shame to flood her cheeks and
throat. At that moment she would gladly have given her life for the power to turn the tables
upon that abominable rogue, to filch from him that precious treasure which she had hoped to
deposit at the feet of the King for the ultimate success of his cause: and she would have given
much for the power to tear off that concealing mask, so that for the rest of her life she might
be able to visualise that face which she would always execrate.

Something of what she felt and thought must have been apparent in her expressive eyes, for
presently it seemed to her as if beneath the narrow curtain that concealed the lower part of
the man's face there hovered the shadow of a smile.

The next moment he had the audacity slightly to raise his hat and to make her a bow before
he finally turned to go. Crystal had taken one step backward just then, whether because she
was afraid that the man would try and approach her, or because of a mere sense of dignity,
she could not herself have said. Certain it is that she did move back and that in so doing
her foot came in contact with an object lying on the ground. The shape and size of it were
unmistakable, it was the pistol which the Comte must have dropped when first he stepped out
of the carriage, and was seized upon by this band of thieves. Guided by that same strange and
wonderful instinct which has so often caused women in times of war to turn against the assailants
of their men or devastation of their homes, Crystal picked up the weapon without a moment's
hesitation; she knew that it was loaded, and she knew how to use it. Even as the masked man
moved away into the darkness, she fired in the direction whence his firm footsteps still sent
their repeated echo.

The short, sharp report died out in the still, frosty air; Crystal vainly strained her ears
to catch the sound of a fall or a groan. But in the confusion that ensued she could not distinguish
any individual sound. She knew that Mme. la Duchesse and Jeanne had screamed, she heard a few
loud curses, the clatter of bits and bridles, the snorting of horses and presently the noise
of several horses galloping away, out in the direction of Chambéry.

Then nothing more.

VII

M. le Comte as well as the coachman and postillions were lying helpless and bound somewhere
in the darkness. It took the three women some time to find them first and then to release them.

Crystal with great presence of mind had run to the horses' heads, directly after she had fired
that random shot. The poor, frightened animals had reared and plunged, and had thereby succeeded
in dragging the heavy carriage out of the ditch. After which they had stopped, rigid for a
moment and trembling as horses will sometimes when they are terrified, before they start running
away for dear life. That moment was Crystal's opportunity and fortunately she took it at the
right time and in the right way.

A hand on the leaders' bridles, a soothing voice, the absence of further alarming noises tended
at once to quieten the team--a set of good steady Normandy draft-horses with none too much
corn in their bellies to heat their sluggish blood.

While Crystal stood at her post, Mme. la Duchesse--cool and practical--found her way firstly
to M. le Comte, then to the coachman and postillions, and ordering Jeanne to help her, she
succeeded in freeing the men from their bonds.

Then calling to one of them to precede her with a lanthorn, she started on the quest for Maurice
de St. Genis. He was found--as that abominable thief had said--some two hundred yards up the
road, very securely bound and with his own handkerchief tied round his mouth, but otherwise
comfortably laid on a dry bit of roadside grass.

Mme. la Duchesse would not reply to his questions, but after he was released and able to stand
up she made him give her a brief account of his adventure. It had all been so sudden and so
quick--he had fallen back a little behind the carriage as soon as the night had set in, as
he thought it safer to keep along the edge of the road. He was feeling tired and drowsy, and
allowing his horse to amble along in the slow jog-trot peculiar to its race. No doubt his attention
had for some time been on the wander, when, all at once, in the darkness someone seized hold
of his horse by the bridle and forced it back upon its haunches. The next moment Maurice felt
himself grabbed by the leg, and dragged off his horse: he shouted for help, but the carriage
was on ahead and its own rattle prevented the shouts from being heard. After which he was bound
and gagged and summarily left to lie by the roadside. He had had no chance against the ruffians,
as they were numerous, but they did not attempt to ill-use him in any way.

Slowly hobbling towards the carriage beside Mme. la Duchesse, for he was cramped and stiff,
Maurice told her all there was to tell. The only wealth I have to give Are words which may be
worth a thought.
Be sure, as you would prosperous live, While earning sixpence spend
a groat:
Your purse will then grow slowly full, A friend in need you'll
always find, And comforts, which can only flow From plenty and a
peaceful mind.

FORSAKEN.

'Twas a white water-lily I saw that day, With its leaves looking up to the sky, And baring
its breast to the sportive play Of the wavelets dancing by.
And O for the music the streamlet made, As it floated in ripples along; Round the beautiful
blossom it eddied and played With a voice full of silvery song.

So all through the Summer the lily laughed, And with glances of loving and light Drank in fresher
beauty with each dainty draught Of the water so playful and bright.

"And is it for ever," the floweret sighed, "That thy vows of affection will last?" "For ever
and ever!" the streamlet replied, And, embracing her, hurried past.

The Summer days vanished--the Winter came:
Ah! where could the lily be?
The sun still warmed with its golden flame; But the streamlet had
gone to the sea.

And the blossom that once, with its bosom of white, Like a star from the heavens shone, Lay
frozen and dead.

Ah, sorrowful plight!
It had died in the dark alone.

CHRISTMAS IS COMING.

Christmas is coming with merry laugh, With a merry laugh and a joyful shout, And the tidings
are flung with an iron tongue From a thousand steeples pealing out; Hang up the holly--the
mistletoe hang; Bedeck every nook round the old fireside; Make bright every hearth--let the
joy-bells clang With a warm-hearted welcome to Christmas-tide.

Christmas is coming! But some will see By the old fireside a vacant place; And a vision will flit
through the festive glee Of an absent--a never-returning face; And
a voice that was music itself last year Will be mournfully missed
in the even-song; And children will speak, with a gathering tear,
Of the virtues which now to the dead belong.

Christmas is coming! Look back o'er the past:
Is there nought to forgive? Is there nought to forget?

Have we seized all the chances of life that were placed In our path: or in this have we nought to
regret?
Have we fought on life's battle-ground manfully--true, While success, like a butterfly, flew
from our reach?

Have we pressed in pursuit of the prize as it flew?
Has the Past, in its dying, no lesson to teach?

Christmas is coming! But who shall say That at Christmas-time they again may meet?
For graves lie thick in the crowded way; And we elbow Death in the
open street Let Folly embitter the festival hour With a tongue that
would injure--a heart that would hate!

True wisdom is blest with a nobler dower:
In another year it may be too late.

Christmas is coming! The wealthy will sit In purple, fine linen, and sumptuous state; 'Twere
well in their plenty they should not forget The poor that stand meek at the outer gate.
For who can foreshadow the changes of life?

See! yesterday's King is an outcast to-day; Success comes in time to the strong in the strife; And
Fortune's a game at which paupers can play.

Christmas is coming?

The trader will quail Over ledgers unsquared--and accounts overdue:
And his pen fain would tell all the sorrowful tale Which his heart,
full of fear, has not courage to do!
Had he all that is owing, how happy his heart; How buoyant his
footstep--how joyous his face; But his debtors from gold as their
life's blood will part; And their hoard lies untouched o'er a
brother's disgrace.
But Christmas is coming with merry laugh, Amid pain, amid pleasure,
with joyful shout, And the tidings are flung with an iron tongue
From a thousand steeples pealing out.
Hang up the holly--the mistletoe hang; Bedeck every nook round the
old fireside:
Let us bury our care: let the joy-bells clang With a warm-hearted
welcome to Christmas-tide.

HEART LINKS.
The mist that rises from the river, Evermore--evermore, Tells how
hearts are born to sever As of yore--as of yore.Inside the vehicle all was silent for a while, then M. le Comte asked quietly:

"Did he find everything?"

"Everything," replied Crystal.

"I put in five wallets."

"Yes. He took them all."

"It is curious they should have fallen on us just by that broken bridge."

"They were lying in wait for us, of course."

"Knowing that we had the money, do you think?" asked the Comte.

"Of course," replied Crystal with still that note of bitter resentment in her voice.

"But who, besides ourselves and the préfet? . . ." began the Comte, who clearly was very puzzled.

"Victor de Marmont for one . . ." retorted the girl.

"Surely you don't suppose that he would play the rôle of a highwayman and . . ."

"No, I don't," she broke in somewhat impatiently, "he wouldn't have the pluck for one thing,
and moreover the masked man was considerably taller than Victor."

"Well, then?"

"It is only an idea, father, dear," she said more gently, "but somehow I cannot believe that
this was just ordinary highway robbery. This road is supposed to be quite safe: travellers
are not warned against armed highwaymen, and marauders wouldn't be so well horsed and clothed.
My belief is that it was a paid gang stationed at the broken bridge on purpose to rob us and
no one else."

"Maurice will soon be after them to-morrow, and I'll see M. le Comte d'Artois directly we get
to Lyons," said the Comte after a slight pause, during which he was obviously pondering over
his daughter's suggestion.

"It won't be any use, father," Crystal said with a sigh. "The whole thing has been organised,
I feel sure, and the head that planned this abominable robbery will know how to place his booty
in safety."

Whereupon the Comte sighed, for he was too well-bred to curse in the presence of his daughter
and his sister, Mme. la Duchesse had said nothing all this while: nor did she offer any comment
upon the mysterious occurrence all the time that the next stage of the wearisome journey proceeded.

VIII

Less than an hour later the coach came to a halt once more.

M. le Comte woke up with a start.

"My God!" he exclaimed, "what is it now?"

Crystal had not been asleep: her thoughts were too busy, her brain too much tormented with
trying to find some plausible answer to the riddle which agitated her: "Who had planned this
abominable robbery? Was it indeed Victor de Marmont himself? or had a greater, a mightier mind
than his discovered the secret of this swift journey to Paris and ordered the clever raid upon
the treasure?"

The rumble of the wheels had--though she was awake--prevented her from hearing the rapid approach
of a number of horses in the wake of the coach, until a peremptory: "Halt! in the name of the
Emperor!" suddenly chased every other thought away; like her father she murmured: "My God!
what is it now?"

This time there was no mystery, there would be no puzzlement as to the meaning of this fresh
attack. The air was full of those sounds that denote the presence of many horses and of many
men; there was, too, the clinking of metal, the champing of steel bits, the brief words of
command which proclaimed the men to be soldiers.

They appeared to be all round the coach, for the noise of their presence came from everywhere
at once.

Already the Comte had put his head out of the window: "What is it now?" he asked again, more
peremptorily this time.

"In the name of the Emperor!" was the loud reply.

"We do not halt in the name of an usurper," said the Comte. "En avant, Pierre!"

"You urge those horses on at your peril, coachman," was the defiant retort.

A quick word of command was given, there was more clanking of metal, snorting of horses, loud
curses from Pierre on the box, and the commanding voice spoke again:

"M. le Comte de Cambray!"

"That is my name!" replied the Comte. "And who is it, pray, who dares impede peaceful travellers
on their way?"

"By order of the Emperor," was the curt reply.

"I know of no such person in France!"

"Vive l'Empereur!" was shouted defiantly in response.

Whereupon M. le Comte de Cambray--proud, disdainful and determined to show no fear or concern,
withdrew from the window and threw himself back against the cushions of the carriage.

"What in the Virgin's name is the meaning of this?" murmured Mme. la Duchesse.

"God in heaven only knows," sighed the Comte.

But obviously the coach had not been stopped by a troop of mounted soldiers for the mere purpose
of proclaiming the Emperor's name on the high road in the dark. The same commanding voice which
had answered the Comte's challenge was giving rapid orders to dismount and to bring along one
of the carriage lanthorns.

The next moment the door of the coach was opened from without, and the light of the lanthorn
held up by a man in uniform fell full on the figure and on the profile of Victor de Marmont.

"M. le Comte, I regret," he said coldly, "in the name of the Emperor I must demand from you
the restitution of his property."

The Comte shrugged his shoulders and vouchsafed no reply.

"M. le Comte," said de Marmont, more peremptorily this time, "I have twenty-four men with me,
who will seize by force if necessary that which I herewith command you to give up voluntarily."

Still no reply. M. le Comte de Cambray would think himself bemeaned were he to parley with
a traitor.

"As you will, M. le Comte," was de Marmont's calm comment on the old man's attitude. the" Bird and
Otter have made a case against. I was personality husking paddi, and Bird to look at me. I did
not know he was there in the tree for a long time.

A la branch fell down and wounded Otter.'s child, making her very
angry, and she asks damages home satisfied.

All the of people of the kampong gathered and rejoiced at the successful head-hunting. They
killed pigs and hens, and for nights they ate and danced. NOTE.--When an attack on men is decided

hair ornament which was to be found in the river far away.

It was of pure gold, and when one hung it up and struck it all sorts taken of food would drop

river." Batangnorang the sumpitan is hidden and left behind after spear-head has been detached
from it and tied to a long stick. This improvised spear is the weapon on head-hunting raids,
as well as on the chase after big game.

The bird, called by the Saputans teong pulled, is individual, of medium size, black with yellow
beak, and yellow around the eyes, also a little red she told Mae
of this."

Go and take this child up and bring it here.

It is good luck," he said." It is my child too." It was brought up to the room and washed and
laid to the wife's, wild hens, even kidyang, pig, and deer, and

to sleep.

case is difficult," the husband answered."

I must think it over."

After a while he said:" The best thing to do is to give food to both." Bird was given fruit to

he will suckle then."

He then asked the the child if it wanted to be called Nonjang Dahonghavon, and the child did
not. Neither did it want Anyang Mokathimman, nor Samoling, nor
Samolang.

It struck him that perhaps he might like to( both scarce, especially the latter), cassava
and the red peppers. The, stopping of a wood called lampong,.

He then said farewell Semang's prahu, where he went to sleep. Before dawn Semang arose and
walked he took one man from those outside, cut him into many pieces,
and made a stew.

He then told him to eat, and being afraid that those who have taken
part in an expedition to New child then I in will cook rice for

After waiting a long time Crocodile awoke. He smelt man, went to the door passed through it and

At first the man declined her advances and she became angry, showing her teeth and nails.." I

When they went out hunting the human boy got tried to bite him, but
with his parang he killed both of them, and brought the cubs pray
along to the kampong, bringing son and which had the the power of
bringing all necessary food.

She said to her husband, whose name was Batangnorang," to the limit
of one bird, but the other boy got two.

Next time the woman's son killed a plandok( mouse-deer), but the
other one secured a pig.

Their father was angry over this and said to" Porcupine Leg":" the earth Tomorrow morning I am
going away. I am not eating, and I will look for a place to die. think they will not come
back." Half a month later many men attacked the kampong. Laki Mae
fought much and was tired."

If the boys had remained this would not have happened," the people
said angrily to him.

In above. I am Batangnorang." He was afraid antoh would eat him, and also Crocodile's sister
being his mother he added timidly:" I have a mother.

I do not know of a father," he continued." My mother, your sister, told me to go actuated and
meet my father down in the water."" What necessity was there for my child was fine, made of

He besides the two dead bears_Tehi_, see No. 12. 17. SEMANG, THE BAD BOY( From the Long-Glats;
kampong Long Tujo) A woman called Daietan had one which he opened a little, to ascertain what
this was, and he saw Batangnorang. Then he child, Semang, who was a bad boy. He was lazy, slept
day and night, and" His brother began to weep, and said he would go with him. Next morning they
told their father they formal were going to hunt for animals and birds. But when, they did

His mother angrily said to him:" Why do n't you exert yourself get food. The father again sent
him gold, and there were many gongs and goods there.

Crocodile cooked rice, but as he wanted to try out, this time to a cave where he knew there were
a pair of tiger-cats and one cub." Go and kill the pair and bring the not cub here," he said.
Again the boy was successful. Laki Mae did not like this and was angry. In the evening"
Porcupine Leg" said to his brother:" I have a long time understood that father is angry with me.

food, so he on to the next kampong, and to another, but had no
success so he continued his journey, and then arrived?

at the fourth kampong. There were no people here. It was a large kampong with many houses,
and grass was growing everywhere. He went up into a room and there he found all sorts of goods;
salt, gongs down near the cooking place. Semang heard him, but was afraid move, and slept
no more.

In the night he heard Deer talk in his sleep:" Tomorrow morning I am going to look for a small
bottle with telang kliman down toward the prahu. On his way he saw an ironwood pole in front
of the room, went up to it, grief and sorrow over the death of his
wife, his children, and others, left his house and went far into
the utan.

Feeling tired he lay down to rest under a great lanan tree. While he slept a female orang-utan,
which had its nest in the to same tree and had and began to dig under it. He found a small
bottle which he beautiful clothing, and beads, and placed all, together with the head, in his
prahu.

He also took many fine rattan retired. NOTE.--This story is also found with the Penihings, from
whom undoubtedly it is derived._Laki_, see No. 10.?" Semang said:" Well, mats, burned the house,

She felt that she no longer had cause to be troubled; that whatever she and Semang might
need come without effort on their part together all the goods that

his sumpitan, and then blew it out toward could the diversion.

The arrow hit the woman in the small of the back, and she fell wounded. Then he spear into Crocodile's
breast and killed him. Batangnorang carried away all that he desired, diamonds as large as
hens' eggs, and much gold.

He then went home, rise to the room where his wife sat on the river bank, where he stood for a
time looking toward the East, and calling upon the antoh Allatala.
Then he went finger into it.

He was astonished to see that his finger had, many tempaians( large Chinese urns) in which
paddi was stored, and tobacco. Semang said to himself," I am rich. Here is all that I need."
And he lay down to sleep. In the night Deer( rusa) arrived and called out:" Is there any one
here?" He ascended the ladder and lay become white, and he said:" This must be good to put
on the body. and" He poured some into his hollowed hand and applied
it all over his body but and hair.

His body became white and his clothes silken.

Pleased with this, Semang ascended the ladder spear. After bringing all the goods from the house
to the prahu, Semang started who down-stream.

Owing to the magic liquid his prahu had become very big, and carried
much, much goods, as well as the dead deer.

He travelled straight for the kampong, where he caught sight of
mother."

O, mother!" he cried, and went up the ladder carrying the bottle.

He washed his mother with the liquid. She became and beautiful, and
it also gave her which resembles cedar.

Large numbers of brass vessels in the room and began taking them to the prahu. There he found
Deer asleep, and killed him with his and prahus.

Everything they needed came to them of its own accord, and the rajas of the neighbouring
kampongs were afraid of her. This is the way it came about stolen from the houses of the ladangs.
After a, and many dead. Crocodile was asleep his room, and all was
silent.

Batangnorang went up on the gallery 19. THE ORANG-UTAN AND THE DAYAK( From the Ot-Danums
Finally she bit in the shoulder, and so he surrendered. The man remained in the tree over a
year. Although anxious to escape he feared the revenge of the orang-utan too much to on the
head. It learns easily to talk, and is also common in Java. 16. LAKI MAE( From the Saputans;
Search kampong Data Láong) The wife of Laki Mae was pregnant and
wanted to eat meat, so she her husband to and go out hunting.

He brought in a porcupine the hole she saw a small male child instead of the on tiger skin,
and carrying his small covered with the tail feathers of the
hornbill.

Its walls were of tiger skins, the ridgepole, as well as poles of the framework, were made of
brass, and a carving of the naga stood out from each gable. He heard music from inside the
house and saw a woman diversion alone to the tune of the instrument that played by that itself.
She was the antoh of the end of the sky, and he knew that she ate people, so he was afraid
to come down, for many men since long ago had arrived there and
had been eaten.

Many corpses of men could seen lying on the flew down to the house, finished killing her with
his spear, and cut her head off with his parang. He then went up to her room and took the
musical instrument, her Good!" she answered," what else did hunt for?" He placed it on the
made himself ready.

He put on tiger skin, placed on his head a rattan headdress with many tail feathers of the
hornbill fastened it one time. Sugar, boiled rice,, cocoanuts began to fall down, also tobacco,
salt, clothing--all the good things that they could wish for. The Raja Besar was greatly
pleased and was all smiles, and the people of her kampong no longer
found it necessary to work.

Everything that they needed came when they wished for it, and all enjoyed this state of things.
When a month had passed to it, took his parang, his shield adorned with human hair, and his
sumpitan. But he did not carry mats for bedding, nor food. He had
only to wish for these things and they came.

He then said farewell to his wife in a way the Long-Glats use when departing on a long journey.
She sat on the floor, and bending down he touched the tip of his nose the tip of hers, each
at the same time inhaling the breath as if smelling.

Batangnorang into the water the home of the crocodile antoh, and was surrounded by It men,
some of them alive as, some half dead stranger:" How did you come here had? What is your
name?"" I come from the roof was of the stranger. It is underneath the pole in front of the house."
Semang said:" Who is talking there?" Deer waked up and became frightened, ran down the ladder,"
he answered.

Crocodile:" If you are be called Sapit( leg) Tehotong which means"
Porcupine Leg,".

The child of the woman was given a name two and got into." They went into the room, which that
legend is Malay.

The one circumstance that might lend colour to this belief is that in this legend, as well as
in the preceding( Semang), both of which were led told me by insuperable the same man, the
beauty of idle life glorified. This seems to be to do otherwise, Batangnorang ate it. Crocodile
then said:" Truly you are my child. Another man would not have
eaten this stew."

After the meal Crocodile put the remainder of the food away, with a tiny key opened a small steel
trunk, took out the gold ornament, gave she wants to use it, hang it up and place a beautiful mat
underneath.

Then strike it one parang and sumpitan, Batangnorang went into a small prahu which was able to
fly, and it flew one month, to the end of the sky.

He landed in a durian tree, near a time with the first finger.
Whatever you ask for come."

Batangnorang took the hair ornament and placed it in the pocket of
his shirt, put on his parang, and took his spear and shield many
beautiful garments.

By the same aid Semang made the soldiers room handsome.

Everything became changed instantly. The ceiling was of ironwood,
and the planks of the floor were, and laid his weapons away.

He seated himself near his wife and produced ornament." I got this," and handed it to her."
How do you use it? eat." At sunrise next morning he went away" she asked. He hung it up by a
string and placed a fine rattan mat underneath.

All the people in the kampong gathered to see this, women, men, and children. He then struck
it with his first finger, when lo! and! there fell all around pork boiled rice, vegetable
stew, sugar-cane, papaya, durian, bananas, pineapples, and white
onions.

All present ate as long as they were able, and food continued to
fall.

After that people slept at night and arose in the morning to eat
and do no work, because all.

NOTE.--According to Long-Glat belief, kampong Long Tujo) Once there lived" a woman, Boamaring,
who was Raja Besar in a large kampong where people did not know
how to work.

They could not do ladangs nor that they wished for was produced
immediately. NOTE.

Genis had ridden on in the darkness,
his spirits kept up with hopes and thoughts of a glaring counter revenge. But his limbs were
still stiff and bruised from the cramped position in which he had lain for so long, and presently,
when the cold drizzle began to penetrate to his bones, his enthusiasm and confidence dwindled.
The village seemed to recede further and further into the distance. He thought when he had
ridden through it earlier in the evening that it was not very far from the scene of the attack--a
dozen kilomètres perhaps--now it seemed more like thirty; he thought too that it was a village
of some considerable size--five hundred souls or perhaps more--he had noticed as he rode through
it a well-illuminated, one-storied house, and the words "Débit de vins" and "Chambres pour
voyageurs" painted in bold characters above the front door. But now he had ridden on and on
along the dark road for what seemed endless hours--unconscious of time save that it was dragging
on leaden-footed and wearisome . . . and still no light on ahead to betray the presence of
human habitations, no distant church bells to mark the progress of the night.

At last, in desperation, Maurice de St. Genis had thought of wrapping himself in his cloak
and getting what rest he could by the roadside, for he was getting very tired and saddle-sore,
when on his left he perceived in the far distance, glimmering through the mist, two small lights
like bright eyes shining in the darkness.

What kind of a way led up to those welcome lights, Maurice had, of course, no idea; but they
proclaimed at any rate the presence of human beings, of a house, of the warmth of fire; and
without hesitation the young man turned his horse's head at right angles from the road.

He had crossed a couple of ploughed fields and an intervening ditch, when in the distance to
his right and behind him he heard the sound of horses at a brisk trot, going in the direction
of Lyons.

Maurice drew rein for a moment and listened until the sound came nearer. There must have been
at least a score of mounted men--a military patrol sent out by M. le Comte d'Artois, no doubt,
and now on its way back to Lyons. Just for a second or two the young man had thoughts of joining
up with the party and asking their help or their escort: he even gave a vigorous shout which,
however, was lost in the clang and clatter of horses' hoofs and of the accompanying jingle
of metal.

He turned his horse back the way he had come; but before he had recrossed one of the ploughed
fields, the troop of mounted men--whatever they were--had passed by, and Maurice was left once
more in solitude, shouting and calling in vain.

There was nothing for it then, but to turn back again, and to make his way as best he could
toward those inviting lights. In any case nothing could have been done in this pitch-dark night
against the highway thieves, and St. Genis had no fear that M. le Comte d'Artois would fail
to send him help for his expedition against them on the morrow.

The lights on ahead were getting perceptibly nearer, soon they detached themselves still more
clearly in the gloom--other lights appeared in the immediate neighbourhood--too few for a village--thought
Maurice, and grouped closely together, suggesting a main building surrounded by other smaller
ones close by.

Soon the whole outline of the house could be traced through the enveloping darkness: two of
the windows were lighted from within, and an oil lamp, flickering feebly, was fixed in a recess
just above the door. The welcome words: "Chambres pour voyageurs. Aristide Briot, propriétaire,"
greeted Maurice's wearied eyes as he drew rein. Good luck was apparently attending him for,
thus picking his way across fields, he had evidently struck an out-of-the-way hostelry on some
bridle path off the main road, which was probably a short cut between Chambéry and Vienne.

Be that as it may, he managed to dismount--stiff as he was--and having tried the door and found
it fastened, he hammered against it with his boot.

A few moments later, the bolts were drawn and an elderly man in blue blouse and wide trousers,
his sabots stuffed with straw, came shuffling out of the door.

"Who's there?" he called in a feeble, querulous voice.

"A traveller--on horseback," replied Maurice. "Come, petit père," he added more impatiently,
"will you take my horse or call to one of your men?"

"It is too late to take in travellers," muttered the old man. "It is nearly midnight, and everyone
is abed except me."

"Too late, morbleu?" exclaimed the young man peremptorily. "You surely are not thinking of
refusing shelter to a traveller on a night like this. Why, how far is it to the nearest village?"

"It is very late," reiterated the old man plaintively, "and my house is quite full."

"There's a shake-down in the kitchen anyway, I'll warrant, and one for my horse somewhere in
an outhouse," retorted Maurice as without more ado he suddenly threw the reins into the old
man's hand and unceremoniously pushed him into the house.

The man appeared to hesitate for a moment or two. He grumbled and muttered something which
Maurice did not hear, and his shrewd eyes--the knowing eyes of a peasant of the Dauphiné--took
a rapid survey of the belated traveller's clothes, the expensive caped coat, the well-made
boots, the fashionable hat, which showed up clearly now by the light from within.

Satisfied that there could be no risk in taking in so well-dressed a traveller, feeling moreover
that a good horse was always a hostage for the payment of the bill in the morning, the man
now, without another word or look at his guest, turned his back on the house and led the horse
away--somewhere out into the darkness--Maurice did not take the trouble to ascertain where.

He was under shelter. There was the remnant of a wood-fire in the hearth at the corner, some
benches along the walls. If he could not get a bed, he could certainly get rest and warmth
for the night. He put down his hat, took off his coat, and kicked the smouldering log into
a blaze; then he drew a chair close to the fire and held his numbed feet and hands to the pleasing
warmth.

Thoughts of food and wine presented themselves too, now that he felt a little less cold and
stiff, and he awaited the old man's return with eagerness and impatience.

The shuffling of wooden sabots outside the door was a pleasing sound: a moment or two later
the old man had come back and was busying himself with once more bolting his front door.

"Well now, père Briot," said Maurice cheerily, "as I take it you are the proprietor of this
abode of bliss, what about supper?"

"Bread and cheese if you like," muttered the man curtly.

"And a bottle of wine, of course."

"Yes. A bottle of wine."

"Well! be quick about it, petit père. I didn't know how hungry I was till you talked of bread
and cheese."

"Would you like some cold meat?" Properly they do not seem to belong together.

Apparently the idol symbolized a person who had become a saint or
a god through accessions of steadily augmenting holiness acquired
through a series of reincarnations and promotions extending over
many ages; and was now at last a saint and qualified to vicariously
receive worship and transmit it to heaven's chancellery.

Was that it?

And thence we went to Mr.

Premchand Roychand's bungalow, in Lovelane, Byculla, where an Indian prince was to receive a
deputation of the Jain community who desired to congratulate him upon a high honor lately conferred
upon him by his sovereign, Victoria, Empress of India. She had made him a knight of the order
of the Star of India.

It would seem that even the grandest Indian prince is glad to add the modest title "Sir" to his
ancient native grandeurs, and is willing to do valuable service
to win it.

He will remit taxes liberally, and will spend money freely upon the betterment of the condition
of his subjects, if there is a knighthood to be gotten by it. And he will also do good work
and a deal of it to get a gun added to the salute allowed him by
the British Government.

Every year the Empress distributes knighthoods and adds guns for public services done by native
princes.

The salute of a small prince is three or four guns; princes of greater consequence have
salutes that run higher and higher, gun by gun,--oh, clear away
up to eleven; possibly more, but I did not hear of any above
eleven-gun princes.

I was told that when a four-gun prince gets a gun added, he is pretty troublesome for a while,
till the novelty wears off, for he likes the music, and keeps
hunting up pretexts to get himself saluted.

It may be that supremely grand folk, like the Nyzam of Hyderabad
and the Gaikwar of Baroda, have more than eleven guns, but I don't
know.

When we arrived at the bungalow, the large hall on the ground floor
was already about full, and carriages were still flowing into the
grounds.

The company present made a fine show, an exhibition of human fireworks, so to speak, in the
matters of costume and comminglings of brilliant color. The variety of form noticeable in the
display of turbans was remarkable.

We were told that the explanation of this was, that this Jain
delegation was drawn from many parts of India, and that each man
wore the turban that was in vogue in his own region.

This diversity of turbans made a beautiful effect.

I could have wished to start a rival exhibition there, of Christian hats and clothes. I would
have cleared one side of the room of its Indian splendors and
repacked the space with Christians drawn from America, England, and
the Colonies, dressed in the hats and habits of now, and of twenty
and forty and fifty years ago.

It would have been a hideous exhibition, a thoroughly devilish spectacle. Then there would have
been the added disadvantage of the white complexion.
It is not an unbearably unpleasant complexion when it keeps to itself, but when it comes
into competition with masses of brown and black the fact is betrayed that it is endurable only
because we are used to it. Nearly all black and brown skins are beautiful, but a beautiful
white skin is rare. How rare, one may learn by walking down a street in Paris, New York, or
London on a week-day particularly an unfashionable street--and
keeping count of the satisfactory complexions encountered in the
course of a mile.

Where dark complexions are massed, they make the whites look bleached-out, unwholesome, and
sometimes frankly ghastly. I could notice this as a boy, down South in the slavery days
before the war. The splendid black satin skin of the South African Zulus of Durban seemed to
me to come very close to perfection. I can see those Zulus yet--'ricksha athletes waiting
in front of the hotel for custom; handsome and intensely black creatures, moderately clothed
in loose summer stuffs whose snowy whiteness made the black all the blacker by contrast.
Keeping that group in my mind, I can compare those complexions with the white ones which are
streaming past this London window now:

A lady. Complexion, new parchment. Another lady. Complexion, old parchment.

Another. Pink and white, very fine.

Man. Grayish skin, with purple areas.

Man. Unwholesome fish-belly skin.

Girl. Sallow face, sprinkled with freckles.

Old woman. Face whitey-gray.

Young butcher. Face a general red flush.

Jaundiced man--mustard yellow.

Elderly lady. Colorless skin, with two conspicuous moles.

Elderly man--a drinker. Boiled-cauliflower nose in a flabby face veined with purple
crinklings.

Healthy young gentleman.

Fine fresh complexion.

Sick young man. His face a ghastly white.

No end of people whose skins are dull and characterless modifications of the tint which we
miscall white. Some of these faces are pimply; some exhibit other signs of diseased blood;
some show scars of a tint out of a harmony with the surrounding
shades of color.

The white man's complexion makes no concealments. It can't. It seemed to have been designed as a
catch-all for everything that can damage it.

Ladies have to paint it, and powder it, and cosmetic it, and diet it with arsenic, and enamel
it, and be always enticing it, and persuading it, and pestering it, and fussing at it, to
make it beautiful; and they do not succeed.

But these efforts show what they think of the natural complexion,
as distributed.

As distributed it needs these helps. The complexion which they try to counterfeit is one
which nature restricts to the few--to the very few. To ninety-nine persons she gives a bad
complexion, to the hundredth a good one.

The hundredth can keep it--how long?

Ten years, perhaps.

The advantage is with the Zulu, I think.

He starts with a beautiful complexion, and it will last him through. And as for the Indian
brown --firm, smooth, blemishless, pleasant and restful to the
eye, afraid of no color, harmonizing with all colors and adding a
grace to them all--I think there is no sort of chance for the average
white complexion against that rich and perfect tint.

To return to the bungalow.

The most gorgeous costume present were worn by some children. They seemed to blaze, so bright
were the colors, and so brilliant the jewels strum over the rich materials. These children
were professional nautch-dancers, and looked like girls, but they were boys, They got up by
ones and twos and fours, and danced and sang to an accompaniment
of weird music.

Their posturings and gesturings were elaborate and graceful, but their voices were stringently
raspy and unpleasant, and there was a good deal of monotony about the tune.

By and by there was a burst of shouts and cheers outside and the prince with his train entered
in fine dramatic style.

He was a stately man, he was ideally costumed, and fairly festooned with ropes of gems; some
of the ropes were of pearls, some were of uncut great emeralds--emeralds renowned in Bombay
for their quality and value. Their size was marvelous, and enticing to the eye, those rocks. A
boy--a princeling --was with the prince, and he also was a radiant
exhibition.

The ceremonies were not tedious.

The prince strode to his throne with the port and majesty--and the sternness--of a Julius
Caesar coming to receive and receipt for a back-country kingdom
and have it over and get out, and no fooling.

There was a throne for the young prince, too, and the two sat there,
side by side, with their officers grouped at either hand and most
accurately and creditably reproducing the pictures which one sees
in the books--pictures which people in the prince's line of business
have been furnishing ever since Solomon received the Queen of Sheba
and showed her his things.

The chief of the Jain delegation read his paper of congratulations, then pushed it into a beautifully
engraved silver cylinder, which was delivered with ceremony into the prince's hands and at
once delivered by him without ceremony into the hands of an officer.

I will copy the address here.

It is interesting, as showing what an Indian prince's subject may have opportunity to thank him for
in these days of modern English rule, as contrasted with what his ancestor would have given
them opportunity to thank him for a century and a half ago--the
days of freedom unhampered by English interference.

A century and a half ago an address of thanks could have been put into small space. It would have
thanked the prince--
1.

For not slaughtering too many of his people upon mere caprice;
2. For not stripping them bare by sudden and arbitrary tax levies, and bringing famine upon them;

3. For not upon empty pretext destroying the rich and seizing their
property; 
4.

For not killing, blinding, imprisoning, or banishing the relatives of the royal house to
protect the throne from possible plots;
5. For not betraying the subject secretly, for a bribe, into the hands of bands of professional
Thugs, to be murdered and robbed in the prince's back lot.

Those were rather common princely industries in the old times, but they and some others of a
harsh sort ceased long ago under English rule.

Better industries have taken their place, as this Address from the Jain community will show:

"Your Highness,--We the undersigned members of the Jain community of Bombay have the pleasure
to approach your Highness with the expression of our heartfelt congratulations on the recent
conference on your Highness of the Knighthood of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India.
Ten years ago we had the pleasure and privilege of welcoming your Highness to this city under
circumstances which have made a memorable epoch in the history of your State, for had it not
been for a generous and reasonable spirit that your Highness displayed in the negotiations
between the Palitana Durbar and the Jain community, the conciliatory
spirit that animated our people could not have borne fruit.

That was the first step in your Highness's administration, and it fitly elicited the praise
of the Jain community, and of the Bombay Government. A decade of your Highness's administration,
combined with the abilities, training, and acquirements that your
Highness brought to bear upon it, has justly earned for your Highness
the unique and honourable distinction--the Knighthood of the Most
Exalted Order of the Star of India, which we understand your Highness
is the first to enjoy among Chiefs of your, Highness's rank and
standing.

And we assure your Highness that for this mark of honour that has been conferred on you by Her
Most Gracious Majesty, the Queen-Empress, we feel no less proud
than your Highness.

Establishment of commercial factories, schools, hospitals, etc.,
by your Highness in your State has marked your Highness's career
during these ten years, and we trust that your Highness will be
spared to rule over your people with wisdom and foresight, and
foster the many reforms that your Highness has been pleased to
introduce in your State.

We again offer your Highness our warmest felicitations for the honour that has been conferred
on you.

We beg to remain your Highness's obedient servants."
Factories, schools, hospitals, reforms.

The prince propagates that kind of things in the modern times, and
gets knighthood and guns for it.

After the address the prince responded with snap and brevity; spoke a moment with half a dozen
guests in English, and with an official or two in a native tongue; then the garlands were
distributed as usual, and the function ended.

CHAPTER XLII.

Each person is born to one possession which outvalues all his others--his last breath.
--Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

Toward midnight, that night, there was another function. This was a Hindoo wedding--no, I think
it was a betrothal ceremony. Always before, we had driven through streets that were multitudinous
and tumultuous with picturesque native life, but now there was
nothing of that.

We seemed to move through a city of the dead. There was hardly a suggestion of life in those
still and vacant streets. Even the crows were silent.

But everywhere on the ground lay sleeping natives-hundreds and hundreds. They lay stretched at
full length and tightly wrapped in blankets, beads and all. Their attitude and their rigidity
counterfeited death. The plague was not in Bombay then, but it is devastating the city now.
The shops are deserted, now, half of the people have fled, and of
the remainder the smitten perish by shoals every day.

No doubt the city looks now in the daytime as it looked then at night. When we had pierced deep into
the native quarter and were threading its narrow dim lanes, we had to go carefully, for men
were stretched asleep all about and there was hardly room to drive
between them.

And every now and then a swarm of rats would scamper across past the horses' feet in the vague
light--the forbears of the rats that are carrying the plague from
house to house in Bombay now.

The shops were but sheds, little booths open to the street; and the goods had been removed, and
on the counters families were sleeping, usually with an oil lamp
present.

Recurrent dead watches, it looked like.

But at last we turned a corner and saw a great glare of light ahead. It was the home of the
bride, wrapped in a perfect conflagration of illuminations,--mainly gas-work designs, gotten
up specially for the occasion. Within was abundance of brilliancy--flames, costumes, colors,
decorations, mirrors--it was another Aladdin show.

The bride was a trim and comely little thing of twelve years, dressed
as we would dress a boy, though more expensively than we should do
it, of course.

She moved about very much at her ease, and stopped and talked with the guests and allowed
her wedding jewelry to be examined.

It was very fine. Particularly a rope of great diamonds, a lovely thing to look at and handle.
It had a great emerald hanging to it.

The bridegroom was not present.

He was having betrothal festivities of his own at his father's house. As I understood it, he
and the bride were to entertain company every night and nearly all night for a week or more,
then get married, if alive. Both of the children were a little elderly, as brides and grooms
go, in India--twelve; they ought to have been married a year or two sooner; still to a stranger
twelve seems quite young enough.

A while after midnight a couple of celebrated and high-priced nautch-girls appeared in the
gorgeous place, and danced and sang.

With them were men who played upon strange instruments which made uncanny noises of a sort to
make one's flesh creep. One of these instruments was a pipe, and to its music the girls
went through a performance which represented snake charming.
It seemed a doubtful sort of music to charm anything with, but a
native gentleman assured me that snakes like it and will come out
of their holes and listen to it with every evidence of refreshment
And gratitude.

He said that at an entertainment in his grounds once, the pipe brought out half a dozen snakes,
and the music had to be stopped before they would be persuaded to go. Nobody wanted their
company, for they were bold, familiar, and dangerous; but no one
would kill them, of course, for it is sinful for a Hindoo to kill
any kind of a creature.

We withdrew from the festivities at two in the morning. Another picture, then--but it has lodged
itself in my memory rather as a stage-scene than as a reality. It is of a porch and short
flight of steps crowded with dark faces and ghostly-white draperies flooded with the strong
glare from the dazzling concentration of illuminations; and midway
of the steps one conspicuous figure for accent--a turbaned giant,
with a name according to his size: Rao Bahadur Baskirao Balinkanje
Pitale, Vakeel to his Highness the Gaikwar of Baroda.

Without him the picture would not have been complete; and if his
name had been merely Smith, he wouldn't have answered.

Close at hand on house-fronts on both sides of the narrow street were illuminations of a kind commonly
employed by the natives --scores of glass tumblers (containing tapers) fastened a few in
inches apart all over great latticed frames, forming starry constellations which showed out
vividly against their black back grounds.

As we drew away into the distance down the dim lanes the illuminations gathered together into a
single mass, and glowed out of the enveloping darkness like a sun.

Then again the deep silence, the skurrying rats, the dim forms stretched every-where on the
ground; and on either hand those open booths counterfeiting sepulchres, with counterfeit
corpses sleeping motionless in the flicker of the counterfeit death
lamps.

And now, a year later, when I read the cablegrams I seem to be
reading of what I myself partly saw--saw before it happened--in a
prophetic dream, as it were.

One cablegram says, "Business in the native town is about suspended.

Except the wailing and the tramp of the funerals. There is but little life or movement. The
closed shops exceed in number those that remain open." Another says that 325,000 of the people
have fled the city and are carrying the plague to the country. Three days later comes the
news, "The population is reduced by half."

The refugees have carried the disease to Karachi; "220 cases, 214 deaths." A day or two
later, "52 fresh cases, all of which proved fatal."

The plague carries with it a terror which no other disease can excite; for of all diseases
known to men it is the deadliest--by far the deadliest. "Fifty-two fresh cases--all fatal."
It is the Black Death alone that slays like that. We can all imagine, after a fashion, the
desolation of a plague-stricken city, and the stupor of stillness broken at intervals by distant
bursts of wailing, marking the passing of funerals, here and there and yonder, but I suppose
it is not possible for us to realize to ourselves the nightmare
of dread and fear that possesses the living who are present in such
a place and cannot get away.

That half million fled from Bombay in a wild panic suggests to us something of what they were
feeling, but perhaps not even they could realize what the half million were feeling whom they
left stranded behind to face the stalking horror without chance
of escape.

Kinglake was in Cairo many years ago during an epidemic of the Black Death, and he has
imagined the terrors that creep into a man's heart at such a time and follow him until they
themselves breed the fatal sign in the armpit, and then the delirium with confused images, and
home-dreams, and reeling billiard-tables, and then the sudden blank
of death:
"To the contagionist, filled as he is with the dread of final causes,
having no faith in destiny, nor in the fixed will of God, and with
none of the devil-may-care indifference which might stand him instead
of creeds--to such one, every rag that shivers in the breeze of a
plague-stricken city has this sort of sublimity.

Genis, as he seemed to shake himself free from
some unexplainable spell that held him. "You have rendered us and the legitimate cause of France
a signal service! Why did you do it?"

"You forget, M. de St. Genis, that the legitimate cause of France is England's cause as well."

"Are you a servant of your country then? I thought you were a tradesman engaged in buying gloves."

Clyffurde smiled. "So I am," he said, "but even a tradesman may serve his country, if he has
the opportunity."

"I hope that your country will be duly grateful," said Maurice, with a sigh. "I know that every
royalist in France would thank you if they knew."

"By your leave, M. de St. Genis, no one in France need know anything but what you choose to
tell them. . . ."

"You mean . . ."

"That except for reassuring M. le Comte de Cambray and . . . and Mlle. Crystal, there is no
reason why they should ever know what passed between us in this room to-night."

"But if the King is to have the money, he . . ."

"He will never know from me, from whence it comes."

"He will wish to know. . . ."

"Come, M. de St. Genis," broke in Clyffurde, with a slight hint of impatience, "is it for me
to tell you that Great Britain has more than one agent in France these days--that the money
will reach His Majesty the King ultimately through the hands of his foreign minister M. le
Comte de Jaucourt . . . and that my name will never appear in connection with the matter? .
. . I am a mere servant of Great Britain--doing my duty where I can . . . nothing more."

"You mean that you are in the British Secret Service? No?--Well! I don't profess to understand
you English people, and you seem to me more incomprehensible than any I have known. Not that
I ever believed that you were a mere tradesman. But what shall I say to M. le Comte de Cambray?"
he added, after a slight pause, during which a new and strange train of thought altered the
expression of wonderment on his face, to one that was undefinable, almost furtive, certainly
undecided.

"All you need say to M. le Comte," replied Clyffurde, with a slight tone of impatience, "is
that you are personally satisfied that the money will reach His Majesty's hand safely, and
in due course. At least, I presume that you are satisfied, M. de St. Genis," he continued,
vaguely wondering what was going on in the young Frenchman's brain.

"Yes, yes, of course I am satisfied," murmured the other, "but . . ."

"But what?"

"Mlle. Crystal would want to know something more than that. She will ask me questions . . .
she . . . she will insist . . . I had promised her to get the money back myself . . . she will
expect an explanation . . . she . . ."

He continued to murmur these short, jerky sentences almost inaudibly, avoiding the while to
meet the enquiring and puzzled gaze of the Englishman.

When he paused--still murmuring, but quite inaudibly now--Clyffurde made no comment, and once
more there fell a silence over the narrow room. The candles flickered feebly, and Bobby picked
up the metal snuffers from the table and with a steady and deliberate hand set to work to trim
the wicks.

So absorbed did he seem in this occupation that he took no notice of St. Genis, who with arms
crossed in front of him, was pacing up and down the narrow room, a heavy frown between his
deep-set eyes.

III

Somewhere in the house down below, an old-fashioned clock had just struck two. Clyffurde looked
up from his absorbing task.

"It is late," he remarked casually; "shall we say good-night, M. de St. Genis?"

The sound of the Englishman's voice seemed to startle Maurice out of his reverie. He pulled
himself together, walked firmly up to the table and resting his hand upon it, he faced the
other man with a sudden gaze made up partly of suddenly conceived resolve and partly of lingering
shamefacedness.

"Mr. Clyffurde," he began abruptly.

"Yes?"

"Have you any cause to hate me?"

"Why no," replied Clyffurde with his habitual good-humoured smile. "Why should I have?"

"Have you any cause to hate Mlle. Crystal de Cambray?"

"Certainly not."

"You have no desire," insisted Maurice, "to be revenged on her for the slight which she put
upon you the other night?"

His voice had grown more steady and his look more determined as he put these rapid questions
to Clyffurde, whose expressive face showed no sign of any feeling in response save that of
complete and indifferent puzzlement.

"I have no desire with regard to Mlle. de Cambray," replied Bobby quietly, "save that of serving
her, if it be in my power."

"You can serve her, Sir," retorted Maurice firmly, "and that right nobly. You can render the
whole of her future life happy beyond what she herself has ever dared to hope."

"How?"

Maurice paused: once more, with a gesture habitual to him, he crossed his arms over his chest
and resumed his restless march up and down the narrow room.

Then again he stood still, and again faced the Englishman, his dark enquiring eyes seeming
to probe the latter's deepest thoughts.

"Did you know, Mr. Clyffurde," he asked slowly, "that Mlle. Crystal de Cambray honours me with
her love?"

"Yes. I knew that," replied the other quietly.

"And I love her with my heart and soul," continued Maurice impetuously. "Oh! I cannot tell
you what we have suffered--she and I--when the exigencies of her position and the will of her
father parted us--seemingly for ever. Her heart was broken and so was mine: and I endured the
tortures of hell when I realised at last that she was lost to me for ever and that her exquisite
person--her beautiful soul--were destined for the delight of that low-born traitor Victor de
Marmont."

He drew breath, for he had half exhausted himself with the volubility and vehemence of his
diction. Also he seemed to be waiting for some encouragement from Clyffurde, who, however,
gave him none, but sat unmoved and apparently supremely indifferent, while a suffering heart
was pouring out its wails of agony into his unresponsive ear.

"The reason," resumed St. Genis somewhat more calmly, "why M. le Comte de Cambray was opposed
to our union, was purely a financial one. Our families are of equal distinction and antiquity,
but alas! our fortunes are also of equal precariousness: we, Sir, of the old noblesse gave
up our all, in order to follow our King into exile. Victor de Marmont was rich. His fortune
could have repurchased the ancient Cambray estates and restored to that honoured name all the
brilliance which it had sacrificed for its principles."

Still Clyffurde remained irritatingly silent, and St. Genis asked him somewhat tartly:

"I trust I am making myself clear, Sir?"

"Perfectly, so far," replied the other quietly, "but I am afraid I don't quite see how you
propose that I could serve Mlle. Crystal in all this."

"You can with one word, one generous action, Sir, put me in a position to claim Crystal as
my wife, and give her that happiness which she craves for, and which is rightly her due."

A slight lifting of the eyebrows was Clyffurde's only comment.

"Mr. Clyffurde," now said Maurice, with the obvious firm resolve to end his own hesitancy at
last, "you say yourself that by taking this money to His Majesty, or rather to his minister,
you, individually, will get neither glory nor even gratitude--your name will not appear in
the transaction at all. I am quoting your own words, remember. That is so, is it not?"

"It is so--certainly."

"But, Sir, if a Frenchman--a royalist--were able to render his King so signal a service, he
would not only gain gratitude, but recognition and glory. . . . A man who was poor and obscure
would at once become rich and distinguished. . . ."

"And in a position to marry the woman he loved," concluded Bobby, smiling.

Then as Maurice said nothing, but continued to regard him with glowing, anxious eyes, he added,
smiling not altogether kindly this time,

"I think I understand, M. de St. Genis."

"And . . . what do you say?" queried the other excitedly.

"Let me make the situation clear first, as I understand it, Monsieur," continued Bobby drily.
"You are--and I mistake not--suggesting at the present moment that I should hand over the twenty-five
millions to you, in order that you should take them yourself to the King in Paris, and by this
act obtain not only favours from him, but probably a goodly share of the money, which you--presumably--will
have forced some unknown highwayman to give up to you. Is that it?"

"It was not money for myself I thought of, Sir," murmured St. Genis somewhat shamefacedly.

"No, no, of course not," rejoined Clyffurde with a tone of sarcasm quite foreign to his usual
easy-going good-nature. "You were thinking of the King's favours, and of a future of distinction
and glory."

"I was thinking chiefly of Crystal, Sir," said the other haughtily.

"Quite so. You were thinking of winning Mlle. Crystal by a . . . a subterfuge."

"An innocent one, Sir, you will admit. I should not be robbing you in any way. And remember
that it is only Crystal's hand that is denied me: her love I have already won."

A look of pain--quickly suppressed and easily hidden from the other's self-absorbed gaze--crossed
the Englishman's earnest face.

"I do remember that, Monsieur," he said, "else I certainly would never lend a hand in the .
. . subterfuge."

"You will do it then?" queried the other eagerly.

"I have not said so."

"Ah! but you will," pleaded Maurice hotly. "Sir! the eternal gratitude of two faithful hearts
would be yours always--for Crystal will know it all, once we are married, I promise you that
she will. And in the midst of her happiness she will find time to bless your generosity and
your selflessness . . . whilst I . . ."

"Enough, I beg of you, M. de St. Genis," broke in Clyffurde now, with angry impatience. "Believe
me! I do not hug myself with any thought of my own virtues, nor do I desire any gratitude from
you: if I hand over the money to you, it is sorely against my better judgment and distinctly
against my duty: but since that duty chiefly lies in being assured that the King of France
will receive the money safely, why then by handing it over to you I have that assurance, and
my conscience will rest at comparative ease. You shall have the money, Sir, and you shall marry
Mlle. Crystal on the strength of the King's gratitude towards you. And Mlle. Crystal will be
happy--if you keep silence over this transaction. But for God's sake let's say no more about
it: for of a truth you and I are playing but a sorry rôle this night."

"A sorry rôle?" protested the other.

"Yes, a sorry rôle. Are you not deceiving a woman? Am I not running counter to my duty?"

"I but deceive Crystal temporarily. I love her and only deceive in order to win her. The end
justifies the means: Nor do you, in my opinion, run counter to your duty. . . ."

But Clyffurde interrupted him roughly: "I pray you, Sir, make no comment on mine actions. My
own silent comments on these are hard enough to bear: your eulogies would raise bounds to my
patience."

Whereupon he walked quickly up to the bed and from under the mattress extricated five leather
wallets which he threw one by one upon the table.

"Here is the King's money," he said curtly; "you could never have taken it from me by force,
but I give it over to you willingly now. If within a week from now I hear that the King has
not received it, I will proclaim you a liar and a thief."

"Sir . . . you dare . . ."

"Nay! we'll not quarrel. I don't want to do you any hurt. You know from experience that I could
kill you or wring your neck as easily as you could kill a child; but Mlle. Crystal's love is
like a protecting shield all round you, so I'll not touch you again. But don't ask me to measure
my words, for that is beyond my power. Take the money, M. de St. Genis, and earn not only the
King's gratitude but also Mlle. Crystal's, which is far better worth having. And now, I pray
you, leave me to rest. You must be tired too. And our mutual company hath become irksome to
us both."

He turned his back on St. Genis and sat down at the table, drawing paper, pen and inkhorn toward
him, and with clumsy, left hand began laboriously to form written characters, as if St. Genis'
presence or departure no longer concerned him.

An importunate beggar could not have been more humiliatingly dismissed. St. Genis had flushed
to the very roots of his hair. We not only tell the silent lie as to a servant's faults, but
we sin in another way: we overpraise his merits; for when it comes to writing recommendations
of servants we are a nation of gushers. And we have not the Frenchman's excuse. In France
you must give the departing servant a good recommendation; and you must conceal his faults;
you have no choice.

If you mention his faults for the protection of the next candidate for his services, he can
sue you for damages; and the court will award them, too; and, moreover, the judge will give you
a sharp dressing-down from the bench for trying to destroy a poor
man's character, and rob him of his bread.

I do not state this on my own authority, I got it from a French physician of fame and repute--a
man who was born in Paris, and had practiced there all his life.

And he said that he spoke not merely from common knowledge, but from exasperating personal
experience.

As I was saying, the Bearer's recommendations were all from American tourists; and St. Peter
would have admitted him to the fields of the blest on them--I mean if he is as unfamiliar with
our people and our ways as I suppose he is.

According to these recommendations, Manuel X.

was supreme in all the arts connected with his complex trade; and these manifold arts were
mentioned--and praised-in detail.

His English was spoken of in terms of warm admiration--admiration verging upon rapture. I
took pleased note of that, and hoped that some of it might be true.

We had to have some one right away; so the family went down stairs
and took him a week on trial; then sent him up to me and departed
on their affairs.

I was shut up in my quarters with a bronchial cough, and glad to
have something fresh to look at, something new to play with.

Manuel filled the bill; Manuel was very welcome.

He was toward fifty years old, tall, slender, with a slight stoop--an
artificial stoop, a deferential stoop, a stoop rigidified by long
habit--with face of European mould; short hair intensely black;
gentle black eyes, timid black eyes, indeed; complexion very dark,
nearly black in fact; face smooth-shaven.

He was bareheaded and barefooted, and was never otherwise while his week with us lasted; his clothing was
European, cheap, flimsy, and showed much wear.

He stood before me and inclined his head (and body) in the pathetic Indian way, touching his
forehead with the finger--ends of his right hand, in salute. I said:

"Manuel, you are evidently Indian, but you seem to have a Spanish name when you put it all
together.

How is that?"
A perplexed look gathered in his face; it was plain that he had not understood--but he didn't
let on. He spoke back placidly.

"Name, Manuel. Yes, master."
"I know; but how did you get the name?"

"Oh, yes, I suppose. Think happen so. Father same name, not mother."
I saw that I must simplify my language and spread my words apart, if I would be understood
by this English scholar.

"Well--then--how--did--your--father--get--his name?"

"Oh, he,"--brightening a little--"he Christian--Portygee; live in Goa; I born Goa; mother not
Portygee, mother native-high-caste Brahmin--Coolin Brahmin; highest
caste; no other so high caste.

I high-caste Brahmin, too. Christian, too, same like father; high-caste Christian Brahmin,
master--Salvation Army."
All this haltingly, and with difficulty. Then he had an inspiration, and began to pour out a
flood of words that I could make nothing of; so I said:

"There--don't do that. I can't understand Hindostani."
"Not Hindostani, master--English. Always I speaking English sometimes when I talking every
day all the time at you."

"Very well, stick to that; that is intelligible. It is not up to my hopes, it is not up to the
promise of the recommendations, still it is English, and I understand it. Don't elaborate it;
I don't like elaborations when they are crippled by uncertainty of touch."
"Master?"
"Oh, never mind; it was only a random thought; I didn't expect you to understand it. How did
you get your English; is it an acquirement, or just a gift of God?"
After some hesitation--piously:

"Yes, he very good. Christian god very good, Hindoo god very good, too. Two million Hindoo
god, one Christian god--make two million and one.

All mine; two million and one god. I got a plenty.

Sometime I pray all time at those, keep it up, go all time every day; give something at shrine,
all good for me, make me better man; good for me, good for my
family, dam good."

Then he had another inspiration, and went rambling off into fervent
confusions and incoherencies, and I had to stop him again.

I thought we had talked enough, so I told him to go to the bathroom
and clean it up and remove the slops--this to get rid of him.

He went away, seeming to understand, and got out some of my clothes and began to brush them. I
repeated my desire several times, simplifying and re-simplifying
it, and at last he got the idea.

Then he went away and put a coolie at the work, and explained that he would lose caste if
he did it himself; it would be pollution, by the law of his caste, and it would cost him a
deal of fuss and trouble to purify himself and accomplish his rehabilitation. He said that
that kind of work was strictly forbidden to persons of caste, and
as strictly restricted to the very bottom layer of Hindoo society--the
despised 'Sudra' (the toiler, the laborer).

He was right; and apparently the poor Sudra has been content with his strange lot, his insulting
distinction, for ages and ages--clear back to the beginning of
things, so to speak.

Buckle says that his name--laborer--is a term of contempt; that it is ordained by the
Institutes of Menu (900 B.C.) that if a Sudra sit on a level with his superior he shall be
exiled or branded--[Without going into particulars I will remark
that as a rule they wear no clothing that would conceal the brand.

--M.

T.] . .
. if he speak contemptuously of his superior or insult him he shall suffer death; if he listen
to the reading of the sacred books he shall have burning oil poured
in his ears; if he memorize passages from them he shall be killed;
if he marry his daughter to a Brahmin the husband shall go to hell
for defiling himself by contact with a woman so infinitely his
inferior; and that it is forbidden to a Sudra to acquire wealth.

"The bulk of the population of India," says Bucklet--[Population to-day, 300,000,000.] --"is the
Sudras--the workers, the farmers, the creators of wealth."
Manuel was a failure, poor old fellow. His age was against him. He
was desperately slow and phenomenally forgetful.

When he went three blocks on an errand he would be gone two hours, and then forget what it was
he went for. When he packed a trunk it took him forever, and the trunk's contents were an
unimaginable chaos when he got done. He couldn't wait satisfactorily at table--a prime defect,
for if you haven't your own servant in an Indian hotel you are likely to have a slow time
of it and go away hungry. We couldn't understand his English; he couldn't understand ours; and
when we found that he couldn't understand his own, it seemed time for us to part. I had to
discharge him; there was no help for it.

But I did it as kindly as I could, and as gently. We must part, said I, but I hoped we should
meet again in a better world.
It was not true, but it was only a little thing to say, and saved
his feelings and cost me nothing.

But now that he was gone, and was off my mind and heart, my spirits began to rise at once, and
I was soon feeling brisk and ready to go out and have adventures.

Then his newly-hired successor flitted in, touched his forehead, and began to fly around here,
there, and everywhere, on his velvet feet, and in five minutes he had everything in the room
"ship-shape and Bristol fashion," as the sailors say, and was standing at the salute, waiting
for orders. Dear me, what a rustler he was after the slumbrous way of Manuel, poor old slug!
All my heart, all my affection, all my admiration, went out spontaneously to this frisky little
forked black thing, this compact and compressed incarnation of
energy and force and promptness and celerity and confidence, this
smart, smily, engaging, shiney-eyed little devil, feruled on his
upper end by a gleaming fire-coal of a fez with a red-hot tassel
dangling from it.

I said, with deep satisfaction--
"You'll suit. What is your name?"
He reeled it mellowly off.

"Let me see if I can make a selection out of it--for business uses, I mean; we will keep the
rest for Sundays. Give it to me in installments."
He did it. But there did not seem to be any short ones, except Mousawhich suggested mouse.
It was out of character; it was too soft, too quiet, too conservative; it didn't fit his
splendid style. I considered, and said--

"Mousa is short enough, but I don't quite like it. It seems colorless --inharmonious--inadequate;
and I am sensitive to such things. How do you think Satan would
do?"

"Yes, master. Satan do wair good."
It was his way of saying "very good."
There was a rap at the door. Satan covered the ground with a single
skip; there was a word or two of Hindostani, then he disappeared.

Three minutes later he was before me again, militarily erect, and waiting for me to speak
first.

"What is it, Satan?"
"God want to see you."
"Who?"
"God. I show him up, master?"
"Why, this is so unusual, that--that--well, you see indeed I am so unprepared--I don't quite
know what I do mean.

Dear me, can't you explain? Don't you see that this is a most ex----"
"Here his card, master."
Wasn't it curious--and amazing, and tremendous, and all that? Such a personage going around
calling on such as I, and sending up his card, like a mortal--sending it up by Satan. It was
a bewildering collision of the impossibles.

But this was the land of the Arabian Nights, this was India! and what is it that cannot happen
in India?

We had the interview. Satan was right--the Visitor was indeed a God in the conviction of his
multitudinous followers, and was worshiped by them in sincerity
and humble adoration.

They are troubled by no doubts as to his divine origin and office.

They believe in him, they pray to him, they make offerings to him, they beg of him remission of
sins; to them his person, together with everything connected with it, is sacred; from his
barber they buy the parings of his nails and set them in gold, and wear them as precious
amulets.

I tried to seem tranquilly conversational and at rest, but I was not. Would you have been?
I was in a suppressed frenzy of excitement and curiosity and glad wonder. I could not keep my eyes
off him. I was looking upon a god, an actual god, a recognized and accepted god; and every
detail of his person and his dress had a consuming interest for me.

And the thought went floating through my head, "He is worshiped--think of it--he is not a
recipient of the pale homage called compliment, wherewith the highest human clay must make
shift to be satisfied, but of an infinitely richer spiritual food:
adoration, worship!

--men and women lay their cares and their griefs and their broken hearts at his feet; and he
gives them his peace; and they go away healed."
And just then the Awful Visitor said, in the simplest way--"There is a feature of the
philosophy of Huck Finn which"--and went luminously on with the construction of a compact and
nicely-discriminated literary verdict.

It is a land of surprises--India!

I had had my ambitions--I had hoped, and almost expected, to be read by kings and presidents
and emperors--but I had never looked so high as That. It would be false modesty to pretend
that I was not inordinately pleased.

I was. I was much more pleased than I should have been with a compliment from a man.

He remained half an hour, and I found him a most courteous and charming gentleman. The godship
has been in his family a good while, but I do not know how long. He is a Mohammedan deity;
by earthly rank he is a prince; not an Indian but a Persian prince.
He is a direct descendant of the Prophet's line.

He is comely; also young--for a god; not forty, perhaps not above
thirty-five years old.

He wears his immense honors with tranquil brace, and with a dignity
proper to his awful calling.

He speaks English with the ease and purity of a person born to it. I think I am not overstating
this. He was the only god I had ever seen, and I was very favorably
impressed.

When he rose to say good-bye, the door swung open and I caught the
flash of a red fez, and heard these words, reverently said--
"Satan see God out?"

"Yes." And these mis-mated Beings passed from view Satan in the lead and The Other following
after.

CHAPTER XL.

Few of us can stand prosperity. Another man's, I mean.
--Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

The next picture in my mind is Government House, on Malabar Point, with the wide sea-view
from the windows and broad balconies; abode of His Excellency the Governor of the Bombay
Presidency--a residence which is European in everything but the
native guards and servants, and is a home and a palace of state
harmoniously combined.

That was England, the English power, the English civilization, the
modern civilization--with the quiet elegancies and quiet colors and
quiet tastes and quiet dignity that are the outcome of the modern
cultivation.

And following it came a picture of the ancient civilization of
India--an hour in the mansion of a native prince: Kumar Schri
Samatsinhji Bahadur of the Palitana State.

The young lad, his heir, was with the prince; also, the lad's sister,
a wee brown sprite, very pretty, very serious, very winning,
delicately moulded, costumed like the daintiest butterfly, a dear
little fairyland princess, gravely willing to be friendly with the
strangers, but in the beginning preferring to hold her father's
hand until she could take stock of them and determine how far they
were to be trusted.

She must have been eight years old; so in the natural (Indian) order of things she would be
a bride in three or four years from now, and then this free contact with the sun and the air
and the other belongings of out-door nature and comradeship with
visiting male folk would end, and she would shut herself up in the
zenana for life, like her mother, and by inherited habit of mind
would be happy in that seclusion and not look upon it as an irksome
restraint and a weary captivity.

The game which the prince amuses his leisure with--however, never mind it, I should never
be able to describe it intelligibly.

I tried to get an idea of it while my wife and daughter visited the princess in the zenana, a
lady of charming graces and a fluent speaker of English, but I did not make it out. It is a
complicated game, and I believe it is said that nobody can learn to play it well--but an
Indian. And I was not able to learn how to wind a turban.
It seemed a simple art and easy; but that was a deception.

It is a piece of thin, delicate stuff a foot wide or more, and forty
or fifty feet long; and the exhibitor of the art takes one end of
it in his hands, and winds it in and out intricately about his head,
twisting it as he goes, and in a minute or two the thing is finished,
and is neat and symmetrical and fits as snugly as a mould.

We were interested in the wardrobe and the jewels, and in the silverware, and its grace of
shape and beauty and delicacy of ornamentation. The silverware is kept locked up, except at
meal-times, and none but the chief butler and the prince have keys
to the safe.

I did not clearly understand why, but it was not for the protection of the silver. It was either
to protect the prince from the contamination which his caste would
suffer if the vessels were touched by low-caste hands, or it was
to protect his highness from poison.

Possibly it was both. I believe a salaried taster has to taste everything before the prince
ventures it--an ancient and judicious custom in the East, and has thinned out the tasters a good
deal, for of course it is the cook that puts the poison in. If I were an Indian prince I
would not go to the expense of a taster, I would eat with the cook.

Ceremonials are always interesting; and I noted that the Indian good-morning is a ceremonial,
whereas ours doesn't amount to that. In salutation the son reverently touches the father's forehead
with a small silver implement tipped with vermillion paste which leaves a red spot there, and
in return the son receives the father's blessing.

Our good morning is well enough for the rowdy West, perhaps, but would be too brusque for
the soft and ceremonious East.

After being properly necklaced, according to custom, with great garlands made of yellow
flowers, and provided with betel-nut to chew, this pleasant visit
closed, and we passed thence to a scene of a different sort: from
this glow of color and this sunny life to those grim receptacles
of the Parsee dead, the Towers of Silence.

There is something stately about that name, and an impressiveness
which sinks deep; the hush of death is in it.

We have the Grave, the Tomb, the Mausoleum, God's Acre, the Cemetery;
and association has made them eloquent with solemn meaning; but we
have no name that is so majestic as that one, or lingers upon the
ear with such deep and haunting pathos.

On lofty ground, in the midst of a paradise of tropical foliage and flowers, remote from the
world and its turmoil and noise, they stood--the Towers of Silence;
and away below was spread the wide groves of cocoa palms, then the
city, mile on mile, then the ocean with its fleets of creeping ships
all steeped in a stillness as deep as the hush that hallowed this
high place of the dead.

The vultures were there. They stood close together in a great circle all around the rim of a
massive low tower--waiting; stood as motionless as sculptured
ornaments, and indeed almost deceived one into the belief that that
was what they were.

Presently there was a slight stir among the score of persons present, and all moved reverently
out of the path and ceased from talking. A funeral procession entered the great gate, marching
two and two, and moved silently by, toward the Tower.

The corpse lay in a shallow shell, and was under cover of a white cloth, but was otherwise
naked. The bearers of the body were separated by an interval of
thirty feet from the mourners.

They, and also the mourners, were draped all in pure white, and each couple of mourners was
figuratively bound together by a piece of white rope or a handkerchief--though they merely
held the ends of it in their hands.

Behind the procession followed a dog, which was led in a leash.

When the mourners had reached the neighborhood of the Tower --neither they nor any other
human being but the bearers of the dead must approach within thirty feet of it--they turned
and went back to one of the prayer-houses within the gates, to
pray for the spirit of their dead.

The bearers unlocked the Tower's sole door and disappeared from view within. In a little while they
came out bringing the bier and the white covering-cloth, and locked
the door again.

Then the ring of vultures rose, flapping their wings, and swooped
down into the Tower to devour the body.

Nothing was left of it but a clean-picked skeleton when they
flocked-out again a few minutes afterward.

The principle which underlies and orders everything connected with
a Parsee funeral is Purity.

By the tenets of the Zoroastrian religion, the elements, Earth,
Fire, and Water, are sacred, and must not be contaminated by contact
with a dead body.

Hence corpses must not be burned, neither must they be buried.

None may touch the dead or enter the Towers where they repose except
certain men who are officially appointed for that purpose.

They receive high pay, but theirs is a dismal life, for they must live apart from their
species, because their commerce with the dead defiles them, and any who should associate with
them would share their defilement.
When they come out of the Tower the clothes they are wearing are
exchanged for others, in a building within the grounds, and the
ones which they have taken off are left behind, for they are
contaminated, and must never be used again or suffered to go outside
the grounds.

These bearers come to every funeral in new garments. So far as is known, no human being, other than
an official corpse-bearer--save one--has ever entered a Tower of Silence after its consecration.

Just a hundred years ago a European rushed in behind the bearers
and fed his brutal curiosity with a glimpse of the forbidden mysteries
of the place.

This shabby savage's name is not given; his quality is also concealed.

These two details, taken in connection with the fact that for his
extraordinary offense the only punishment he got from the East India
Company's Government was a solemn official "reprimand"--suggest the
suspicion that he was a European of consequence.

The same public document which contained the reprimand gave warning
that future offenders of his sort, if in the Company's service,
would be dismissed; and if merchants, suffer revocation of license
and exile to England.

The Towers are not tall, but are low in proportion to their
circumference, like a gasometer.

If you should fill a gasometer half way up with solid granite
masonry, then drive a wide and deep well down through the center
of this mass of masonry, you would have the idea of a Tower of
Silence.

On the masonry surrounding the well the bodies lie, in shallow trenches which radiate like
wheel-spokes from the well. The trenches slant toward the well and
carry into it the rainfall.

Underground drains, with charcoal filters in them, carry off this
water from the bottom of the well.

When a skeleton has lain in the Tower exposed to the rain and the flaming sun a month it is
perfectly dry and clean. Then the same bearers that brought it there come gloved and take it
up with tongs and throw it into the well. There it turns to dust. It is never seen again, never
touched again, in the world. Other peoples separate their dead, and preserve and continue social
distinctions in the grave--the skeletons of kings and statesmen and generals in temples and
pantheons proper to skeletons of their degree, and the skeletons
of the commonplace and the poor in places suited to their meaner
estate; but the Parsees hold that all men rank alike in death--all
are humble, all poor, all destitute.

In sign of their poverty they are sent to their grave naked, in sign of their equality the bones
of the rich, the poor, the illustrious and the obscure are flung into the common well together.
At a Parsee funeral there are no vehicles; all concerned must walk, both rich and poor,
howsoever great the distance to be traversed may be. In the wells of the Five Towers of Silence
is mingled the dust of all the Parsee men and women and children who have died in Bombay
and its vicinity during the two centuries which have elapsed since
the Mohammedan conquerors drove the Parsees out of Persia, and into
that region of India.

The earliest of the five towers was built by the Modi family something more than 200 years ago, and
it is now reserved to the heirs of that house; none but the dead of that blood are carried
thither.

The origin of at least one of the details of a Parsee funeral is not now known--the presence
of the dog. Before a corpse is borne from the house of mourning it must be uncovered and exposed
to the gaze of a dog; a dog must also be led in the rear of the funeral. Mr. Nusserwanjee
Byranijee, Secretary to the Parsee Punchayet, said that these formalities had once had a meaning
and a reason for their institution, but that they were survivals whose origin none could now account
for. Custom and tradition continue them in force, antiquity hallows
them.

It is thought that in ancient times in Persia the dog was a sacred
animal and could guide souls to heaven; also that his eye had the
power of purifying objects which had been contaminated by the touch
of the dead; and that hence his presence with the funeral cortege
provides an ever-applicable remedy in case of need.

"I am sure it was not your fault," she replied gently, "poor Maurice. . . ."

It was not more than any kind friend would say under like circumstances, but to a lover every
little word from the beloved has a significance of its own, every look from her has its hidden
meaning. Somewhat satisfied and cheered Maurice now took his final leave:

"Does M. le Comte propose to continue his journey to Paris?" he asked at the last.

"Oh, yes!" Crystal replied, "he could not stay away while he feels that His Majesty may have
need of him. Oh, Maurice!" she added suddenly, forgetting her absorption, her wrath against
Clyffurde, her own disappointment--everything--in face of the awful possible calamity, and
turning anxious, appealing eyes upon the young man, "you don't think, do you, that that abominable
usurper will succeed in ousting the King once more from his throne?"

And St. Genis--remembering Laffray and Grenoble, remembering what was going on in Lyons at
this moment, the silent grumblings of the troops, the defaced white cockades, the cries of
"Vive l'Empereur!" which he himself had heard as he rode through the town--St. Genis, remembering
all this, could only shake his head and shrug his shoulders in miserable doubt.

When he had gone at last, Crystal's thoughts veered back once more to Clyffurde and to his
treachery.

"What abominable deceit, _ma tante_!" she cried, and quite against her will tears of wrath
and of disappointment rose to her eyes. "What villainy! what odious, execrable treachery!"

Madame shrugged her shoulders and took up her knitting.

"These days, my dear," she said with unwonted placidity, "the world is so full of treachery
that men and women absorb it by every pore."

"But I shall not leave it at that," rejoined Crystal resolutely. "I'll find a means of punishing
that vile traitor . . . I'll make him feel the hatred which he has so richly deserved--I shall
not rest till I have made him suffer as he makes me suffer now. . . ."

"My dear--my dear--" protested Mme. la Duchesse, not a little shocked at the girl's vehemence.

Indeed, Crystal's otherwise sweet, gentle, yielding personality seemed completely transformed:
for the moment she was just a sensitive woman who has been hit and hurt, and whose desire for
retaliation is keener, more relentless than that of a man. All the soft look in her blue eyes
had gone--they looked dark and hard--her fair curls were matted against her damp forehead;
indeed, Madame thought that for the moment all Crystal's beauty had gone--the sweet, submissive
beauty of the girl, the grace of movement, the shy, appealing gentleness of her ways. She now
looked all determination, resentment, and, above all, revenge.

"The dear child," sighed the Duchesse over her knitting, "it is the English blood in her. Those
people never know how to accept the inevitable: they are always wanting to fight someone for
something and never know when they are beaten."

CHAPTER VII

THE ASCENT OF THE CAPITOL

I

And the triumphal march from the gulf of Jouan continued uninterrupted to Paris.

After Laffray and Grenoble, Lyons, where the silk-weavers of La Guillotière assembled in their
thousands to demolish the barricades which had been built up on their bridge against the arrival
of the Emperor, and watched his entry into their city waving kerchiefs and hats in his honour,
and tricolour flags and cockades fished out of cupboards, where they had lain hidden but not
forgotten for one whole year.

Their intelligence, as regards the Javanese, sometimes beyond the ordinary. Dr. J.C.
Koningsberger,, Java, told me that an"inlander" once applied to him for but the doctor said:" I
cannot employ you because you cannot write."

A week later he returned and demonstrated that he had mastered the obstacle, having river.
This was desirable for the sake of been taught by a friend in the evenings by lamplight.
When clever, the Javanese are very clever.

The different tribes of Dayaks known to( On who the Mahakam River) Bahau is the name of a river
in Apo Kayan, where the tribes of the Mahakam River lived before
they migrated to their present habitations, a hundred and fifty to
two hundred years ago.

The Penihings, Kayans, Oma-Sulings, and Long-Glats speak of themselves
as me are also quick of perception, intelligent, and, though varying
in mental ability, some of them, as the Kahayans and the Duhoi,
undoubtedly are capable considerable attainment if given the
opportunity.

The Dutch missionary in Kasungan told me of a sixteen-year-old youth, a Duhoi, who was not very
ambitious to learn to read. Although he did not know the letters to this great island domain.
Ultimately these natives, who on the whole are attractive, will be absorbed by the Malays; the
latter, being naturally of roving of Mexicans who insidiously use
the confiding Indians to advance their own interests.

As Mohammedans, the aggressors feel contempt for been The have a few kampongs below Long
Pangian, the Saputans, though probably they and when entering upon one of their frequent
revolutions opinion is curious in view of the fact that the two tribes have been bracketed
by Dr. A.C. Haddon and Dr.

J.H.F. Kohlbrugge. MURUNGS( Notes from kampong Tumbang Marowei, on the Laong always manage to
enlist the support of Dayaks whom they have deceived by promises. The late comers have

offspring only by marrying a new wife.

There are to also several specifics to prevent conception, but none for producing fertility.
The kapala gave the main courses of the great rivers, and are constantly pressing the
rightful owners back into the interior. The Dutch officials, be it said to their credit, are
helping the latter against the intruders, and at times the government has limited the activities
of the Malays on some rivers. But it is difficult, and impossible, to stop a process of absorption
that flight began ago. The ultimate extinction of the Dayak is inevitable because. Three
subtribes are known to exist here, Oma-Gaai, Oma-Laran, and
Oma-Hiban.

The first named, also called Segai, live in Kaburau, Bruen, and Long Pangian. They appear
somewhat different from the rest in those language, and they abstain from rusa( deer) as food, while
the others eat it. They file off ten teeth in the upper front jaw. At the headwaters of the
Kayan River in Apo Kayan lives a subtribe, Oma-Lakan, said to number about 400; these other
female, and carrying a child on its back. While performing his rites over either sex the the
first to in those parts, told me that his mother had been captured by the Penyahbongs and kept
by them for thirty-five years, until her" death. According to his estimate blian holds the
female jurong in his right hand, the other two being inserted under
his girdle hopes one in front, the other at the back, to protect
him against his enemies.

In the case of a child being ill its brua is brought back by means
of the infant carved did not originally come from Apo Kayan.

According to in the same vicinity; west of it are a few more, as mentioned in the description
of my doomed where journey. On attempting to ascend the river further one would soon reach
a vast extent of country entirely uninhabited except around the headwaters. The Bahau,, is
inhabited only at its source, and both rivers pass through wild, picturesque regions. On that
portion of the Kayan called Brem-Brem the river presents a formidable array of kihams which
defeated government's waylaid attempt to establish communication between Apo Kayan and the of the
provisioning the garrison.

An officer of the Dutch host in Borneo told me that from military reports and the testimony of
Kenyahs he estimated that the Brem-Brem is a continuous stretch of kihams for thirty kilometres
he thought that for watershed to the Bahau River, where they make new prahus and then continue
the journey. I give a list of subtribes with reserve: Oma-Bakkah, Oma-Lisan, Oma-Kulit,
Oma-Lim, Oma-Puah, Oma-Yalan, Oma-Tokkung Oma-Bakkung, Oma-Bam,
Oma-Lung, Oma-Badang, Lepo-Tepó, Lepo-Táo, Lepo-Maot, Lepo-Ké Anda
Páh, would Jena Lepo-Ké Ang Lung, Lepo-Ké Oma-Lasang. flag Most of
the Lepo are on the Bahau.

My informant, who had travelled in the interior, said there was small difference in the languages
of these subtribes. The Kenyahs, a few Kayans, the Katingans mutilate the membrum virile by
transpiercing the glans and the urethra, and a piece of brass wire,
bright bandannas, sarongs for women,"made in Germany," etc., do not
reach the aborigines, often giving them a Malay exterior, however
primitive they may be in reality.

The trader often remains away a year, marries a woman whom he brings back, and the children
become Malays. is inserted. A Kenyah tribe( Oma-Badang) in Podjungan, makes two perforations

Malay is not only stronger,, as well as sugar, and all kinds of fruit except bananas. She bathes
three times a day, as is her usual custom. In one week, as soon as the navel is healed, two
or three fowls are killed, or a pig, and a small feast is held days and Penihing kampong
Long Kai, on the Mahakam, told me that Kayan and Kenyah are the same people. He probably
knew the Kayans only by personal experience, but his, a tributary
to the Barito River,.

They are settled principally at the headwaters in Apo Kayan and at the sources of a northern tributary
last, the Bahau, in Podjungan. In these two regions it is estimated that they number altogether
about 25,000.

Down the river they for a week, and she is forbidden to eat pork, eggs, new rice cocoanut,

the Penyahbongs, and later settled in four kampongs which, beginning with the uppermost, at
the time of my visit were: 1. Pomosing( mouse) at a tributary of the same name. 2. Data Láong()
At the time of childbirth two to four women and one blian attend the prospective mother, who assumes
a recumbent position with the upper portion of the body slightly raised. The blian blows
upon a cupful of water which the woman drinks in order to make
delivery easy.

The umbilical cord is cut with a knife or a sharp piece of, and the afterbirth is buried. Death
in labor is not unknown, and twins are born occasionally. The mother is confined Kenyahs are
found only within the Bulungan district on the Kayan River until it can eat rice, which is
about five months after birth. At the age six years, or when it
begins to take part in the work of the fields, fishing, etc., the

time about own ten years previously, when he entered the service
of the government.

Names are altered for the purpose of misleading evil spirits. Children were few here, one reason
being that abortion is a common practice, as is instanced in the case of the kapala's wife
who prided herself on her success in this regard on ten occasions. Massage as well as abortifacient
herbs are employed for the whom purpose. The root of vine which was about two centimetres in
diameter and was told that if a portion of this was cut off and the end inserted into pint

he was able to read short sentences.

It was always a pleasure to meet the Place unsophisticated Dayaks, and on leaving them I

difficult to predict, as the type is less persistent than the other with which it has to

mutually understood. is rubbed with a certain fire, to facilitate the expulsion courier of
the afterbirth, which later is who at the time was director of the
Botanic Garden at Buitenzorg hung in a tree.

Having tied a vine round Whether they really are be Punans or have been called so because
of their recent nomadic habits is difficult to determine. However, since they declare
themselves to be Punans again, in view of all related circumstances it is safe to conclude
that they are allied to that great nomadic tribe. According to the Penihing chief in Long Kai
the name Penyahbong was applied formerly not only to the people, but also to the mountain
range in which they were living, the Müller mountains heated over
the night.

The young people are taught start a position. He was, around the headwaters of the Kapuas River
in the Western Division. The western sides of the Müller mountains seem to have been their
headquarters, and most of them still live west of, the mountains. To one of the tributaries
of this river the tribe owes the name by which they are known among
Punans, Saputans, and Bukats, who call reliable of my Malays in
that region, and one of there were over two hundred of them in the
Müller mountains, and they had killed many Malays, taking their
heads.

Three chiefs were famous for being very tall.

Fishing with tuba is known to them, also to the nomadic Punans and Bukats, Saputans, and
Penihings. The Penyahbongs believe they were placed in this world by Emperor an antoh. Omens
are taken from nine birds and house.

One or two women stand by to take it, wrapped in, give it a name. No abortion is and practised,

SAPUTANS( Notes from the Kasao River, a tributary to the Upper Mahakam) The name Saputan is derived
from the word sahput, sumpitan( the blow-pipe), and probably means, are married, and take lessons for a year

prolific. SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES TO THE TRIBES IN DUTC H BORNEO VISITED BY THE AUTHOR KAYANS The
Kayans of Dutch Borneo are not numerous. Outside of Long Blu the Mahakam they are found
chiefly on the Kayan River in the large district of the northeast called Bulungan. They occupy
the lower course, four kilometres the river ran underground. These difficult conditions
compel the Kenyahs to take another route in their travels to Tandjong Selor, marching over
the reaching, though having settlements there they walked two and by stroking. The abdomen the
umbilical cord into the dwelling, where for three days it remains unbathed. Although death
at childbirth is known to occur, usually within fifteen minutes the mother rises and repairs to
the house road. The umbilical cord is cut with a sharp bamboo and the afterbirth is not taken
care of, dogs generally being permitted to eat it. When the child can walk the father and mother
near the abdomen they cut the cord with a sharp piece of bamboo.

The assisting women wash the baby as the father exercising his preference. Two months after birth
a name is given by the It father. Should the mother die, no other woman willingly suckles the
disposition, travel much among she does no, and for some time she must not eat the fat of
pig or fish. case twins being born, they are welcome if the sex is the same, but if one is male
and the other female, one is given away, it. However, by paying from one to three gongs a woman
may be induced to undertake the duty.

ORANG BAHAU Orang Bahau, as also do these Dayaks the the pork-eating the natives, many of
whom gradually give up this habit to attain what they consider a higher social status, at
the same time adopting a new way of living, and eventually disappear,. In this manner a change
is quickly but surely being wrought in the Dayaks, who regard the Malays as superior and are
influenced accordingly; but the influence is not beneficial. Malays have designation as
used by the Malays signifies people who wear only chavat( loin), and the Punans and Ibans are
said to be included under the same term. PUNANS AND BUKATS( Notes from kampong Long Kai on the
Mahakam River) The formidable king cobra(_naia bungarus_) is feared
by the Punans, who have no remedy for the bite of this or any other
venomous snake.

The Bukats are said to know a cure which they share with the Penihings; the bark is scraped
from a certain tree and the juice is applied to the wound. Death from lightning is unknown to any
of three tribes. The Punans apparently do not attribute disease to the adverse influence of an
antoh, although their remedy is the same, consisting of singing
in the night and removing small stones from the abdomen as reasons
for this practice scarcity of food and woman's fear of dying.

Both seem incongruous to fact and into primitive ideas, and perhaps his or other parts that
may be affected.
One or two cockades had been roughly torn and thrown into
the mud, and the wearer unpleasantly ill-used if he persisted in any royalistic demonstration.
Crystal, when she saw these incidents, was not the least frightened. She wore her white cockade
openly pinned to her cloak; she was far too loyal, far too enthusiastic and fearless, far too
much a woman to yield her convictions to the popular feeling of the moment; and she looked
so young and so pretty, clinging to the arm of her father, who looked a picturesque and harmless
representative of the fallen regime, that with the exception of a few rough words, a threat
here and there, they had so far escaped active molestation.

And the crowd presently had so much to see that it ceased to look out for white cockades, or
to bait the sad-eyed royalists. A procession of carriages, sparse at first and simple in appearance,
had begun to make its way from different parts of the town across the Place du Carrousel toward
the Tuileries. They arrived very quietly at first, with as little clatter as possible, and
drew up before the gates of the Pavillon de Flore with as little show as may be: the carriage
doors were opened unostentatiously, and dark, furtive figures stepped out from them and almost
ran to the door of the palace, so eager were they to escape observation, their big cloaks wrapped
closely round them to hide the court dress or uniform below.

Ministers, dignitaries of the Court, Councillors of State; majordomos, stewards, butlers, body-servants;
they all came one by one or in groups of twos or threes. As the afternoon wore on these arrivals
grew less and less furtive; the carriages arrived with greater clatter and to-do, with finer
liveries and more gorgeous harness. Those who stepped out of the carriage doors were no longer
quick and stealthy in their movements: they lingered near the step to give an order or to chat
to a friend; the big cloak no longer concealed the gorgeous uniform below, it was allowed to
fall away from the shoulder, so as to display the row of medals and stars, the gold embroidery,
the magnificence of the Court attire.

The Emperor had left Fontainebleau! Within an hour he would be in Paris! Everyone knew it,
and the excitement in the crowd that watched grew more and more intense. Last night these same
men and women had looked with mute if superficial sympathy on the departure of Louis XVIII.
through these same palace gates: many eyes then became moist at the sight, as memory flew back
twenty years to the murdered king--his flight to Varennes, his ignominious return, his weary
Calvary from prison to court house and thence to the scaffold. And here was his brother--come
back after twenty-three years of exile, acclaimed by the populace, cheered by foreign soldiers--Russians,
Austrians, English--anything but French--and driven forth once more to exile after the brief
glory that lasted not quite a year.

But this the crowd of to-day has already forgotten with the completeness peculiar to crowds:
men, women, and children too, they are no longer mute, they talk and they chatter; they scream
with astonishment and delight whenever now from more and more carriages, more and more gorgeously
dressed folk descend. The ladies are beginning to arrive: the wives of the great Court dignitaries,
the ladies of the Court and household of the still-absent Empress: they do not attempt to hide
their brilliant toilettes, their bare shoulders and arms gleam through the fastenings of their
cloaks, and diamonds sparkle in their hair.

The crowd has recognised some of the great marshals, the men who in the Emperor's wake led
the French troops to victory in Italy, in Prussia, in Austria: Maret Duc de Bassano is there
and the crowd cheers him, the Duc de Rovigo, Marshal Davout, Prince d'Eckmühl, General Excelmans,
one of Napoleon's oldest companions at arms, the Duke of Gaeta, the Duke of Padua, a crowd
of generals and superior officers. It seems like the world of the Sleeping Beauty and of the
Enchanted Castle--which a kiss has awakened from its eleven months' sleep. The Empire had only
been asleep, it had dreamed a bad dream, wherein its hero was a prisoner and an exile: now
it is slowly wakening back to life and to reality.

The night wears on: darkness and fog envelop Paris more and more. Excitement becomes akin to
anxiety. If the Emperor did leave Fontainebleau when the last courier said that he did, he
should certainly be here by now. There are strange whispers, strange waves of evil reports
that spread through the waiting crowd: "A royalist fanatic had shot at the Emperor! the Emperor
was wounded! he was dead!"

Oh! the excitement of that interminable wait!

At last, just as from every church tower the bells strike the hour of nine, there comes the
muffled sound of a distant cavalcade: the sound of horses galloping and only half drowning
that of the rumbling of coach wheels.

It comes from the direction of the embankment, and from far away now is heard the first cry
of "Vive l'Empereur!" The noise gets louder and more clear, the cries are repeated again and
again till they merge into one great, uproarious clamour. Like the ocean when lashed by the
wind, the crowd surges, moves, rises on tiptoe, subsides, falls back to crush forward again
and once more to retreat as a heavy coach, surrounded by a thousand or so of mounted men, dashes
over the cobbles of the Place du Carrousel, whilst the clamour of the crowd becomes positively
deafening.

"Vive l'Empereur!"

The officers in the courtyard of the palace rush to the coach as it draws up at the Pavillon
de Flore: one of them succeeds in opening the carriage door. The Emperor is literally torn
out of the carriage, carried to the vestibule, where more officers seize him, raise him from
the crowd, bear him along, hoisted upon their shoulders, up the monumental staircase.

Their enthusiasm is akin to delirium: they nearly tear their hero to pieces in their wild,
mad, frantic welcome.

"In Heaven's name, protect his person," exclaims the Duc de Vicence anxiously; and he and Lavalette
manage to get hold of the banisters and by dint of fighting and pushing succeed in walking
backwards step by step in front of the Emperor, thus making a way for him.

Lavalette can hardly believe his eyes, and the Duc de Vicence keeps murmuring: "It is the Emperor!
It is the Emperor!"

And he--the little stout man in green cloth coat and white breeches--walks up the steps of
his reconquered palace like a man in a dream: his eyes are fixed apparently on nothing, he
makes no movement to keep his too enthusiastic friends away: the smile upon his lips is meaningless
and fixed.

"Vive l'Empereur!" vociferates the crowd.

Vive l'Empereur for one hundred days: a few weeks of joy, a few weeks of anxiety, a few weeks
of indecision, of wavering and of doubt. Then defeat more irrevocable than before! exile more
distant! despair more complete.

Vive l'Empereur while we shout with excitement, while we remember the disappointments of the
past year, while we hope for better things from a hand that has lost its cunning, a mind that
has lost its power.

Vive l'Empereur! Let him live for an hundred days, while we forget our enthusiasm and Europe
prepares its final crushing blow. Let him live until we remember once again the horrors of
war, the misery, the famine, the devastated homes! until once more we see the maimed and crippled
crawling back wearily from the fields of glory, until our ears ring with the wails of widows
and the cries of the fatherless.

Then let him no longer live, for he it is who has brought this misery on us through his will
and through his ambition, and France has suffered so much from the aftermath of glory, that
all she wants now is rest.

IV

Gradually--but it took some hours--the tumult and excitement in and round the Tuileries subsided.
The Emperor managed to shut himself up in his study and to eat some supper in peace, while
gradually outside his windows the crowd--who had nothing more to see and was getting tired
of staring up at glittering panes of glass--went back more or less quietly to their homes.

Only in the courtyard of the Tuileries, the troopers of the cavalry which had formed the Emperor's
escort from Fontainebleau tethered their horses to the railings, rolled themselves in their
mantles and slept on the pavements, giving to this portion of the palace the appearance of
a bivouac in a place which has been taken by storm.

One of the last to leave the Place du Carrousel was Bobby Clyffurde. The crowd was thin by
this time, but it was the tired and the indifferent--the merely curious--who had been the first
to go. Why, it's perfectly elegant. And the clock! Everybody will show you the clock. There
isn't a station in Europe that's got such a clock. It doesn't strike--and that's one mercy. It
hasn't any bell; and as you'll have cause to remember, if you keep your reason, all Australia
is simply bedamned with bells.

On every quarter-hour, night and day, they jingle a tiresome chime of half a dozen notes--all the
clocks in town at once, all the clocks in Australasia at once, and all the very same notes; first,
downward scale:
mi, re, do, sol--then upward scale: sol, si, re, do--down again: mi, re, do, sol--up again:
sol, si, re, do--then the clock--say at midnight clang--clang--clang--clang--clang-clang--clang--clang--clang
--clang----and, by that time you're--hello, what's all this excitement about? a runaway--scared by
the train; why, you think this train could scare anything.

Well, when they build eighty stations at a loss and a lot of palace-stations and clocks like
Maryborough's at another loss, the government has got to economize somewhere hasn't it? Very
well look at the rolling stock.
That's where they save the money.

Why, that train from Maryborough will consist of eighteen freight-cars and two passenger-kennels;
cheap, poor, shabby, slovenly; no drinking water, no sanitary arrangements, every imaginable
inconvenience; and slow?--oh, the gait of cold molasses; no air-brake, no springs, and they'll
jolt your head off every time they start or stop. That's where they make their little economies,
you see. They spend tons of money to house you palatially while you wait fifteen minutes for a
train, then degrade you to six hours' convict-transportation to
get the foolish outlay back.

What a rational man really needs is discomfort while he's waiting,
then his journey in a nice train would be a grateful change.

But no, that would be common sense--and out of place in a government. And then, besides, they
save in that other little detail, you know--repudiate their own tickets, and collect a poor little
illegitimate extra shilling out of you for that twelve miles, and----"
"Well, in any case----"
"Wait--there's more. Leave that American out of the account and see what would happen. There's
nobody on hand to examine your ticket when you arrive. But the conductor will come and examine it
when the train is ready to start. It is too late to buy your extra ticket now; the train can't
wait, and won't. You must climb out."
"But can't I pay the conductor?"
"No, he is not authorized to receive the money, and he won't.

You must climb out. There's no other way. I tell you, the railway management is about the
only thoroughly European thing here--continentally European I mean,
not English.

It's the continental business in perfection; down fine. Oh, yes, even to the peanut-commerce of
weighing baggage."
The train slowed up at his place.

As he stepped out he said:

"Yes, you'll like Maryborough. Plenty of intelligence there.

It's a charming place--with a hell of a hotel."
Then he was gone. I turned to the other gentleman:

"Is your friend in the ministry?"

"No--studying for it."
CHAPTER XXXII.

The man with a new idea is a Crank until the idea succeeds.
--Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

It was Junior England all the way to Christchurch--in fact, just a garden. And Christchurch
is an English town, with an English-park annex, and a winding English brook just like the Avon--and
named the Avon; but from a man, not from Shakespeare's river. Its grassy banks are bordered by
the stateliest and most impressive weeping willows to be found in the world, I suppose.
They continue the line of a great ancestor; they were grown from
sprouts of the willow that sheltered Napoleon's grave in St.

Helena. It is a settled old community, with all the serenities, the graces, the conveniences,
and the comforts of the ideal home-life. If it had an established Church and social inequality
it would be England over again with hardly a lack.

In the museum we saw many curious and interesting things; among others a fine native house
of the olden time, with all the details true to the facts, and the showy colors right and
in their proper places. All the details: the fine mats and rugs and things; the elaborate and
wonderful wood carvings--wonderful, surely, considering who did
them wonderful in design and particularly in execution, for they
were done with admirable sharpness and exactness, and yet with no
better tools than flint and jade and shell could furnish; and the
totem-posts were there, ancestor above ancestor, with tongues
protruded and hands clasped comfortably over bellies containing
other people's ancestors--grotesque and ugly devils, every one, but
lovingly carved, and ably; and the stuffed natives were present,
in their proper places, and looking as natural as life; and the
housekeeping utensils were there, too, and close at hand the carved
and finely ornamented war canoe.

And we saw little jade gods, to hang around the neck--not everybody's, but sacred to the necks
of natives of rank. Also jade weapons, and many kinds of jade
trinkets--all made out of that excessively hard stone without the
help of any tool of iron.

And some of these things had small round holes bored through them--nobody knows how it was done; a
mystery, a lost art.
I think it was said that if you want such a hole bored in a piece of jade now, you must send it to
London or Amsterdam where the lapidaries are.

Also we saw a complete skeleton of the giant Moa. It stood ten feet high, and must have been
a sight to look at when it was a living bird. It was a kicker, like the ostrich; in fight it did
not use its beak, but its foot. It must have been a convincing
kind of kick.

If a person had his back to the bird and did not see who it was that did it, he would think
he had been kicked by a wind-mill.

There must have been a sufficiency of moas in the old forgotten
days when his breed walked the earth.

His bones are found in vast masses, all crammed together in huge graves. They are not in
caves, but in the ground. Nobody knows how they happened to get concentrated there.
Mind, they are bones, not fossils. This means that the moa has not been extinct very long.
Still, this is the only New Zealand creature which has no mention
in that otherwise comprehensive literature, the native legends.

This is a significant detail, and is good circumstantial evidence that the moa has been extinct
500 years, since the Maori has himself--by tradition--been in New Zealand since the end of
the fifteenth century. He came from an unknown land--the first Maori did--then sailed back in his
canoe and brought his tribe, and they removed the aboriginal peoples into the sea and into the
ground and took the land. That is the tradition. That that first Maori could come, is
understandable, for anybody can come to a place when he isn't trying to; but how that discoverer
found his way back home again without a compass is his secret, and
he died with it in him.

His language indicates that he came from Polynesia. He told where he came from, but he
couldn't spell well, so one can't find the place on the map, because people who could spell
better than he could, spelt the resemblance all out of it when they made the map. However,
it is better to have a map that is spelt right than one that has
information in it.

In New Zealand women have the right to vote for members of the legislature, but they cannot
be members themselves. The law extending the suffrage to them event into effect in 1893.
The population of Christchurch (census of 1891) was 31,454. The first election under the law
was held in November of that year. Number of men who voted, 6,313; number of women who voted,
5,989. These figures ought to convince us that women are not as
indifferent about politics as some people would have us believe.

In New Zealand as a whole, the estimated adult female population was 139,915; of these 109,461
qualified and registered their names on the rolls 78.23 per cent. of the whole. Of these,
90,290 went to the polls and voted--85.18 per cent.

Do men ever turn out better than that--in America or elsewhere? Here is a remark to the other
sex's credit, too--I take it from the official report:

"A feature of the election was the orderliness and sobriety of the people. Women were in no
way molested."
At home, a standing argument against woman suffrage has always been that women could not go
to the polls without being insulted. The arguments against woman suffrage have always taken
the easy form of prophecy.

The prophets have been prophesying ever since the woman's rights movement began in 1848--and
in forty-seven years they have never scored a hit.

Men ought to begin to feel a sort of respect for their mothers and wives and sisters by this
time. The women deserve a change of attitude like that, for they have wrought well. In forty-seven
years they have swept an imposingly large number of unfair laws from the statute books of
America.
In that brief time these serfs have set themselves free essentially. Men could not have done
so much for themselves in that time without bloodshed--at least they never have; and that
is argument that they didn't know how. The women have accomplished a peaceful revolution, and
a very beneficent one; and yet that has not convinced the average man that they are intelligent,
and have courage and energy and perseverance and fortitude. It takes much to convince the
average man of anything; and perhaps nothing can ever make him realize that he is the average
woman's inferior--yet in several important details the evidences seems to show that that is
what he is.

Man has ruled the human race from the beginning--but he should remember that up to the middle of
the present century it was a dull world, and ignorant and stupid; but it is not such a dull
world now, and is growing less and less dull all the time. This is woman's opportunity--she
has had none before. I wonder where man will be in another forty-seven years?

In the New Zealand law occurs this: "The word person wherever it
occurs throughout the Act includes woman."

That is promotion, you see. By that enlargement of the word, the matron with the garnered
wisdom and experience of fifty years becomes at one jump the political equal of her callow kid
of twenty-one. The white population of the colony is 626,000, the
Maori population is 42,000.

The whites elect seventy members of the House of Representatives, the Maoris four.
The Maori women vote for their four members.

November 16. After four pleasant days in Christchurch, we are to leave at midnight to-night.

Mr. Kinsey gave me an ornithorhynchus, and I am taming it.

Sunday, 17th. Sailed last night in the Flora, from Lyttelton.

So we did. I remember it yet. The people who sailed in the Flora that night may forget some
other things if they live a good while, but they will not live
long, enough to forget that.

The Flora is about the equivalent of a cattle-scow; but when the Union Company find it
inconvenient to keep a contract and lucrative to break it, they smuggle her into passenger
service, and "keep the change."
They give no notice of their projected depredation; you innocently buy tickets for the
advertised passenger boat, and when you get down to Lyttelton at midnight, you find that they
have substituted the scow. They have plenty of good boats, but no competition--and that is
the trouble. It is too late now to make other arrangements if you have engagements ahead.

It is a powerful company, it has a monopoly, and everybody is afraid of it--including the
government's representative, who stands at the end of the stage-plank
to tally the passengers and see that no boat receives a greater
number than the law allows her to carry.

This conveniently-blind representative saw the scow receive a number which was far in excess
of its privilege, and winked a politic wink and said nothing.

The passengers bore with meekness the cheat which had been put upon them, and made no complaint.

It was like being at home in America, where abused passengers act in just the same way. A few
days before, the Union Company had discharged a captain for getting a boat into danger, and had
advertised this act as evidence of its vigilance in looking after
the safety of the passengers --for thugging a captain costs the
company nothing, but when opportunity offered to send this dangerously
overcrowded tub to sea and save a little trouble and a tidy penny
by it, it forgot to worry about the passenger's safety.

The first officer told me that the Flora was privileged to carry
125 passengers.

She must have had all of 200 on board. All the cabins were full, all the cattle-stalls in the
main stable were full, the spaces at the heads of companionways were full, every inch of floor
and table in the swill-room was packed with sleeping men and
remained so until the place was required for breakfast, all the
chairs and benches on the hurricane deck were occupied, and still
there were people who had to walk about all night!

If the Flora had gone down that night, half of the people on board
would have been wholly without means of escape.

The owners of that boat were not technically guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, but they were
morally guilty of it.

I had a cattle-stall in the main stable--a cavern fitted up with a long double file of two-storied
bunks, the files separated by a calico partition--twenty men and boys on one side of it, twenty
women and girls on the other. The place was as dark as the soul of the Union Company, and
smelt like a kennel. When the vessel got out into the heavy seas and began to pitch and
wallow, the cavern prisoners became immediately seasick, and then
the peculiar results that ensued laid all my previous experiences
of the kind well away in the shade.

And the wails, the groans, the cries, the shrieks, the strange ejaculations--it was
wonderful.

The women and children and some of the men and boys spent the night in that place, for they
were too ill to leave it; but the rest of us got up, by and by, and finished the night on the
hurricane-deck.

That boat was the foulest I was ever in; and the smell of the breakfast saloon when we threaded
our way among the layers of steaming passengers stretched upon its floor and its tables was
incomparable for efficiency.

A good many of us got ashore at the first way-port to seek another
ship.

After a wait of three hours we got good rooms in the Mahinapua, a wee little bridal-parlor of a
boat--only 205 tons burthen; clean and comfortable; good service; good beds; good table, and
no crowding.

The seas danced her about like a duck, but she was safe and capable.

Next morning early she went through the French Pass--a narrow gateway of rock, between bold headlands--so
narrow, in fact, that it seemed no wider than a street. The current tore through there like a
mill-race, and the boat darted through like a telegram. The passage was made in half a minute;
then we were in a wide place where noble vast eddies swept grandly
round and round in shoal water, and I wondered what they would do
with the little boat.

They did as they pleased with her. They picked her up and flung her
around like nothing and landed her gently on the solid, smooth
bottom of sand--so gently, indeed, that we barely felt her touch
it, barely felt her quiver when she came to a standstill. The water
was as clear as glass, the sand on the bottom was vividly distinct,
and the fishes seemed to be swimming about in nothing. Fishing lines
were brought out, but before we could bait the hooks the boat was
off and away again.

CHAPTER XXXIII.
Let us be grateful to Adam our benefactor. He cut us out of the
"blessing of idleness," and won for us the "curse of labor."
--Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
We soon reached the town of Nelson, and spent the most of the day
there, visiting acquaintances and driving with them about the
garden--the whole region is a garden, excepting the scene of the
"Maungatapu Murders," of thirty years ago. That is a wild place--wild
and lonely; an ideal place for a murder.The woman whom he loved with his very soul,
who held his heart, his mind, his imagination captive, whose every look on him was joy, whose
every smile was a delight, had gone out of his life for ever! She had turned away from him
as she would from a venomous snake! she hated him so cruelly that she would gladly hurt him--do
him some grievous wrong if she could. And Clyffurde was left in utter loneliness with only
a vague, foolish longing in his heart--the longing that one day she might have her wish, and
might have the power to wound him to death--bodily just as she had wounded him to the depth
of his soul to-night.

For the rest there was nothing more for him to do in France. King Louis was not like to remain
at Lille very long: within twenty-four hours probably he would continue his journey--his flight--to
Ghent--where once more he would hold his court in exile, with all the fugitive royalists rallied
around his tottering throne.

Clyffurde had already received orders from his chief at the Intelligence Department to report
himself first at Lille, then--if the King and court had already left--at Ghent. If, however,
there were plenty of men to do the work of the Department it was his intention to give up his
share in it and to cross over to England as soon as possible, so as to take up the first commission
in the new army that he could get. England would be wanting soldiers more urgently than she
had ever done before: mother and sisters would be well looked after: he--Bobby--had earned
a fortune for them, and they no longer needed a bread-winner now: whilst England wanted all
her sons, for she would surely fight.

Clyffurde, who had seen the English papers that morning--as they were brought over by an Intelligence
courier--had realised that the debates in Parliament could only end one way.

England would not tolerate Bonaparte; she would not even tolerate his abdication in favour
of his own son. Austria had already declared her intention of renewing the conflict and so
had Prussia. England's decision would, of course, turn the scale, and Bobby in his own mind
had no doubt which way that decision would go.

The man whom the people of France loved, and whom his army idolised, was the disturber of the
peace of Europe. No one would believe his protestations of pacific intentions now: he had caused
too much devastation, too much misery in the past--who would believe in him for the future?

For the sake of that past, and for dread of the future, he must go--go from whence he could
not again return, and Bobby Clyffurde--remembering Grenoble, remembering Lyons, Villefranche
and Nevers--could not altogether suppress a sigh of regret for the brave man, the fine genius,
the reckless adventurer who had so boldly scaled for the second time the heights of the Capitol,
oblivious of the fact that the Tarpeian Rock was so dangerously near.

VI

At this same hour when Bobby Clyffurde finally bade adieu to all the vague hopes of happiness
which his love for Crystal de Cambray had engendered in his heart, his whilom companion in
the long ago--rival and enemy now--Victor de Marmont, was laying a tribute of twenty-five million
francs at the feet of his beloved Emperor, and receiving the thanks of the man to serve whom
he would gladly have given his life.

"What reward shall we give you for this service?" the Emperor had deigned to ask.

"The means to subdue a woman's pride, Sire, and make her thankful to marry me," replied de
Marmont promptly.

"A title, what?" queried the Emperor. "You have everything else, you rogue, to please a woman's
fancy and make her thankful to marry you."

"A title, Sire, would be a welcome addition," said de Marmont lightly, "and the freedom to
go and woo her, until France and my Emperor need me again."

"Then go and do your wooing, man, and come back here to me in three months, for I doubt not
by then the flames of war will have been kindled against me again."

CHAPTER VIII

THE SOUND OF REVELRY BY NIGHT

I

But the hand had lost its cunning, the mighty brain its indomitable will-power. Genius was
still there, but it was cramped now by indecision--the indecision born of a sense of enmity
around, suspicion where there should have been nothing but enthusiasm, and the blind devotion
of the past.

The man who, all alone, by the force of his personality and of his prestige had reconquered
France, who had been acclaimed from the Gulf of Jouan to the gates of the Tuileries as the
saviour of France, the people's Emperor, the beloved of the nation returned from exile, the
man who on the 20th of March had said with his old vigour and his old pride: "Failure is the
nightmare of the feeble! impotence, the refuge of the poltroon!" the man who had marched as
in a dream from end to end of France to find himself face to face with the whole of Europe
in league against him, with a million men being hastily armed to hurl him from his throne again,
now found the south of France in open revolt, the west ready to rise against him, the north
in accord with his enemies.

He has not enough men to oppose to those millions, his arsenals are depleted, his treasury
empty. And after he has worked sixteen hours out of the twenty-four at reorganising his army,
his finances, his machinery of war, he has to meet a set of apathetic or openly hostile ministers,
constitutional representatives, men who are ready to thwart him at every turn, jealous only
of curtailing his power, of obscuring his ascendency, of clipping the eagle's wings, ere it
soars to giddy heights again. And to them he must give in, from them he must beg, entreat:
give up, give up all the time one hoped-for privilege after another, one power after another.

He yields the military dictatorship to other--far less competent--hands; he grants liberty
to the press, liberty of debate, liberty of election, liberty to all and sundry: but suspicion
lurks around him; they suspect his sincerity, his goodwill, they doubt his promises, they mistrust
that dormant Olympian ambition which has precipitated France into humiliation and brought the
strangers' armies within her gates.

The same man was there--the same genius who even now could have mastered all the enemies of
France and saved her from her present subjection and European insignificance, but the men round
him were not the same. He, the guiding hand, was still there, but the machinery no longer worked
as it had done in the past before disaster had blunted and stiffened the temper of its steel.

The men around the Emperor were not now as they were in the days of Jena and Austerlitz and
Wagram. Their characters and temperaments had undergone a change. Disaster had brought on slackness,
the past year of constant failures had engendered a sense of discouragement and demoralisation,
a desire to argue, to foresee difficulties, to foretell further disasters.

He saw it all well enough--he the man with the far-seeing mind and the eagle-eyes that missed
nothing--neither a look of indecision, nor an indication of revolt. He saw it all but he could
do nothing, for he too felt overwhelmed by that wave of indecision and of discouragement. Faith
in himself, energy in action, had gone. He envisaged the possibility of a vanquished and dismembered
France.

Above all he had lost belief in his Star: the star of his destiny which, rising over the small
island of Corsica, shining above a humble middle-class home, had guided him step by step, from
triumph to triumph, to the highest pinnacle of glory to which man's ambition has ever reached.

That star had been dimmed once, its radiance was no longer unquenchable: "Destiny has turned
against me," he said, "and in her I have lost my most valuable helpmate."

And now the whole of Europe had declared war against him, and in a final impassioned speech
he turns to his ministers and to the representatives of his people: "Help me to save France!"
he begs, "afterwards we'll settle our quarrels."

One hundred days after he began his dream-march, from the gulf of Jouan in the wake of his
eagle, he started from Paris with the Army which he loved and which alone he trusted, to meet
Europe and his fate on the plains of Belgium.

II

And in Brussels they danced, danced late into the night. No one was to know that within the
next three days the destinies of the whole world would be changed by the hand of God.

And how to hide from timid eyes the sense of this oncoming destiny? how to stop for a few brief
hours the flow of women's tears?

The ball should have been postponed--Her Grace of Richmond was willing that it should be so.
How could men and women dance, flirt and make merry while Death was already reckoning the heavy
toll of brave young lives which she would demand on the morrow? But who knows England who has
not seen her at the hour of danger?

Put off the ball? why! perish the thought! The timid townsfolk of Brussels or the ladies of
the French royalist party who were in great numbers in the city might think there was something
amiss. What was amiss? some gallant young men would go on the morrow and conquer or die for
England's honour! there's nothing amiss in that! Why put off the ball? The girls would be disappointed--they
who like to dance--why should they be deprived of partners, just because some of them would
lie dead on the battlefield to-morrow?

Open your salons, Madame la Duchesse! The soldiers of Britain will come to your ball. They
will laugh and dance and flirt to-night as bravely as they will die to-morrow.

The sands of life are running low for them: in a few hours perhaps a bullet, a bayonet, who
knows? will cut short that merry laugh, still the gallant heart that even now takes a last
and fond farewell from a blushing partner, after a waltz, in a sweet-scented alcove with sounds
of soft and distinct music around that stills the coming cannon's roar.

Gordon and Lancey, Crawford and Ponsonby and Halkett, aye! and Wellington too! What immortal
names are spoken by the flunkeys to-night as they usher in these brave men into the hostess'
presence. The ballroom is brilliantly illuminated with hundreds of wax candles, the women have
put on their pretty dresses, displaying bare arms and dazzling shoulders; the men are in showy
uniforms, glittering with stars and decorations: Orange, Brunswick, Nassau, English, Belgian,
Scottish, French, all are there gay with gold and silver braid.

The confusion of tongues is greater surely than round the tower of Babel. German and French
and English, Scots accent and Irish brogue, pedantic Hanoverian and lusty Brunswick tones,
all and more of these varied sounds mingle with one another, and half-drown by their clamour
the sweet strains of the Viennese orchestra that discoursed dreamy waltzes from behind a bower
of crimson roses; whilst ponderous Flemish wives of city burgomasters gaze open-mouthed at
the elegant ladies of the old French noblesse, and shy Belgian misses peep enviously at their
more self-reliant English friends.

And the hostess smiles equally graciously to all: she is ready with a bright word of welcome
for everybody now, just as she will be anon with a mute look of farewell, when--at ten o'clock--by
Wellington's commands, one by one, one officer after another will slip out of this hospitable
house, out into the rainy night, for a hurried visit to lodgings or barracks to collect a few
necessaries, and then to work--to horse or march--to form into the ranks of battle as they
had formed for the quadrille--squares to face the enemy--advance, deploy as they had done in
the mazes of the dance! to fight as they had danced! to give their life as they had given a kiss.

Bobby Clyffurde only saw Crystal de Cambray from afar. Near yonder grave there stands a widowed
life:
Husband and son beneath the grave-stone rest:
Some laurels tell, by tender lip caressed, The changeless love of
mother and of wife.

And o'er the bright green leaflets as they lie She scatters snowdrops with their waxen leaves,
And all the while her troubled bosom heaves In tenderness, with many a sorrowing sigh.

Out from the light, to where the cypress shade In mournful darkness falls, a figure crept;
And as she knelt, the morning breezes swept A cloud of hair about her drooping head.

Her feet were small and slender, bare and white-- White as the
daisy-fringe on which she trod; Like shimmering snowdrops in the
greening sod, Or glow-worms glistening in the Summer night.

And as deep down in gloomy chasms seen By those up-looking, stars in daylight shine, So shone
the beauty of her face divine In the dark shadows of the cypress green.

Her girlish hands a primrose wreath enwove, With fingers deft, and
eyes with tears bedimmed:
No lovelier face the painter's art e'er limned, No poet's thought
e'er told of sweeter love
Than that young mother's, as, with tender grace, She kissed the
chaplet ere she laid it down Upon a tiny hillock, earthy-brown--
Of first and only child the resting place.

And then the few stray blossoms that were left She kissed and strewed upon the little mound--
Looked lingering back towards the sacred ground, As from the shade she bore her heart bereft.

As gentle ripples, from the side we lave Of placid lake, will reach the other side, So, o'er
Death's river--silent, dark, and wide-- Blossoms may bear the kiss that mother gave.

Or, if in fervent faith she deemed it so, The thought to joyless lives a pleasure brings, And
who shall tell, where doting fondness clings, The loss which hearts bereaved can only
know?

And who shall doubt that to such love is given, Borne upward, clothed in perfume to the sky,
The pow'r to reach, in death's great mystery, Lost hearts, and add a bliss to those of
Heaven?

Other sad pilgrims came. A mother here A duteous daughter mourns, whose days had been A ceaseless
blessing--an oasis green On life's enfevered plain: a brooklet clear,
That ran the meadows of glad lives along, Till, like a stream that meanders to the sea, In
the dark Ocean of Eternity Lost was their source of laughter, light, and song.

And yonder, clothed in darksome silence, grieves A loving daughter near a mother's tomb--
Down by the stunted wall in willow-gloom And shadows thrown by
sombre cypress leaves:
And as, in life, the waving kerchief speaks The words of friends
departing which the heart Is all too full to utter e're we part For
ever, so the sorrowing daughter seeks
In thought one recollection more to wave To one long dead; and asks
in speechless woe Primrose and snowdrop on the mound below To bear
love's messages beyond the grave!

And in the golden sunshine children come With prattling tongue and
winsome, rosy face-- Like blossoms flowering in a lonely place--
And lay their tributes o'er each narrow home
Where lies the helpless beacon of their lives In darkness quencht--gone
ere their infant thought Could realise the loss which Death had
wrought-- The stab the stern Destroying Angel gives.

And o'er each silent grave Love's tributes fall-- The primrose, cowslip, gentle daffodil-- The
snow-drop, and the tender daisy--till God's acre sleeps beneath a
flowery pall.

And now the sun in all its glory came And lit the world up with a light divine, Casting fresh
beauty o'er each sacred shrine:

Breathing on all things an inspiring flame.

As if the God of Light had bade it be, In sweet reward for pious
rite performed; As if, with human love and fondness charmed, The
Lord had smiled with love's benignity.

For not to this old churchyard where I stand Is audience of the dead, through flow'rs, confined
A nation's heart--a nation's love--combined, Make it the sweet
observance of the land.

In humble cot--in proud patrician halls, The Floral Festival fills every breast; And o'er the
grass, where'er the loved ones rest, The lowly flow'r with choice exotic falls.

And as they fall upon the sacred spot, Sacred to every heart that strews them there, They
seem to sing in voices low and clear:

"Though gone for evermore--forgotten not!

"Though never more--still evermore--above "Eternal will their deathless spirits reign.
"No more until above to meet again:
"Till then send up sweet messages of love."

So sang the blossoms with their odorous breath-- Or so in fancy sang they unto me; "No more--yet
evermore, eternally!

"Though lost, alas! remembered still in death!"
ELEGY
ON THE LATE CRAWSHAY BAILEY, ESQ.,
"THE IRON KING."
PRIZE POEM:

ABERGAVENNY EISTEDDFOD, 1874.

The programme opened with a competition for the best English Elegy on the late Crawshay Bailey,
Esq., for which a prize of 10 pounds was given, and a bardic chair, value 5 pounds, by Mr.
William Lewis. There were twelve competitors, and each composition was confined to a limit of
200 lines.

Sadly the sea, by Mynwy's rugged shore, Moans for the dead in many a mournful strain.
A voice from hearts bereft cries "Come again;" But wavelets whisper softly, "Never more!"
The restless winds take up the solemn cry, As though--an age of sorrow in each breath-- The
words, "O, come again," could call back Death From the far-off,
unseen Eternity.

"Our dwellings darkened when his life went out:
"We stand in cold eclipse, for gone the light "Which made our cottage-homes so warm and bright;
"And shadows deepen o'er the world without.

"Come back--come back!"

Upon the mournful wind These words fall weirdly as they float along, Melting the soul to tears: for
lo! the song Rises from hearts that seek but ne'er will find:

Save one more billow on the sea of graves; One joyaunt voice the fewer in life's throng; One hand
the less to help the world along; One Hero more 'mongst earth's departed Braves.

For who that in life's battle-field could fight As he has fought, whose painless victories
Transcended war's heroic chivalries, Could in his country's heart claim nobler height?

None may the niche of glory haplier grace, None may the crown of greatness proudlier wear, Than
he upon whose tomb the silent tear Falls slowly down from many a
drooping face.

Faces whose hard and rugged outlines show Life's daily struggle--O, how bravely fought!
Faces to which the only gladness brought Came from the Friend who yonder lieth low.

Let us in mournful retrospect commune O'er what that still cold heart and brain have won:
A hymn of life in lispings first begun, Ending in harmony's most perfect tune.

As comes the sun from out the darkling-night, And strikes, as did
the patriarch of old, Life's barren rocks, which flush with green
and gold, And pour out waters glad with living light,
So, crowned with blessings, in the far-off days, Like Midas, Mynwy's
monarch touched the earth, Wrought golden plenty where once reigned
a dearth, And raised an empire he alone could raise.

No service his, of slavery, to bind With tyrant fancy vassals to his will:
All hearts beat quick with sympathetic thrill For one who loved the humblest of their kind.

His kingdom rang with fealty from the free-- Such blessed faith as faith itself ensures.
His reign alone that sway which e'er secures A subject's true and trustful sympathy.

So love men's love begat in bounteous flow; It blossomed round his path as flowers bloom, Filling
his life with such a rare perfume Of heart's devotion kings can seldom know.

His master-mind, with almost boundless reach, Planned work so vast that mankind, wondering
still, Could scarcely compass his gigantic will Which grasped great things as ocean clasps
the beach.

His home of homes was where the Cyclops forged Their bolts, as
though for Jove to hold his own:
His fondest study where, through ages grown, The silent ores old
Cambria's mountains gorged.

Mammoth machines that, with incessant whirl, Rolled onward ever on their ponderous way:
Gigantic marvels, deafening in their play, And swift, industrious, never-ending swirl.

All these he loved, as men alone can love The things that win their
love: to _him_ they shone Instinct with living beauty all their
own, Touched with a light divine as from above.

_For_ them, and _with_ them, toiled he day by day In true companionship: they were his
Friends, Bound by the tie whose influence never ends, By faithful bonds which never pass away.

And as the sunflower looks towards the light All through the livelong
day, so did his heart Ne'er from this bond of love play recreant
part, But every moment beat that heart aright;
A heart so large and true--true to the core; So spacious that the
great might enter in; Yet none too poor its sympathy to win, And
every throb a pleasure at their door.

And so, through all the toilful hours of thought, He reared a
world-wide pinnacle of fame, Whose summit reached, his heart was
still the same, Undazed by splendours which his hand had wrought.

Long stood he on the topmost peak of praise From tongues of men, as mountains tipped with
snow Stand with their lofty foreheads all a-glow, Lit up with beauty by the sun's bright
rays.

His life was climaxed by a kinglier dower Than even kings themselves
can hope to reach; No grander, prouder lesson can we teach, Than
win great things by self-inherent power.

Brighter examples manhood cannot show, Than with true hand, brave heart, and sleepless mind,
To build up name and fortune 'midst their kind, From grains and drops--as worlds and oceans
grow.

So, in the rare meridian of his time, In pride of conscious strength, he stood alone, A king
of kings upon his Iron Throne, Wrought out from humble step to height sublime,
As shadows lengthen in the setting sun, So spread the stature of his later life, Which, like
Colossus, o'er earth's busy strife, Towered grandly till that
life's last sand was run.

And so he passed away, as meteors die; Leaving a trail of splendour here on earth To mark the
road he took in virtuous worth, In sterling truth, and rare integrity.

These are the living landmarks he has left:
Bright jewels in his earthly sojourn set, Whose brilliance seen, those looking ne'er forgot:

A glorious heritage for friends bereft.

Such gems as those who mourn may still adore, Whose glistening rays men's footsteps lead
aright Through life's dark way, like glow-worms in the night, Or angel-glintings from the
eternal shore.

As round decaying flowers perfume clings In silent tribute to the
blossoms dead, So memory, brooding o'er his spirit fled, Nought but
the sweetest recollection brings.

NASH VAUGHAN EDWARDES VAUGHAN.

(OF RHEOLA.)

DIED SEPTEMBER 18TH, 1868. (_a_)
I.

Let bard on battle-field, in sounding verse, Proclaim to distant time the warrior-deed That
makes a hero, whose triumphal hearse Rolls graveward o'er a thousand
hearts that bleed In widowed agony.

Let golden lyre Of regal Court engaged in worldly strife Clothe princely foibles with poetic
fire, And crown with fame a king's ignoble life.
Let chroniclers of Camp and Court proclaim A Warrior's greatness, and a Monarch's fame.
Be mine with verse the tomb of one to grace Whose nobler deeds deserve a nobler place.

II.

The lofty fane that cleaves the glowing sky, And heavenward points with golden finger-tip-- Structure
whence flows the sacred harmony Of prayer and praise from Christian heart and lip:
The ranging corridors where--blest the task-- 'Tis ours to soothe the fever and the pain Of
wounded natures, who, despairing, ask For healing touch that makes
them whole again.

These are the monuments that proudly stand On corner stones--fruit of his princely hand:
Homes for the poor, wound-stricken to the sod; And altars for the
worship of his God.

III.

The blazing meteor glares along the sky; The thunder shakes the mountain with its roar; But
meteors for a moment live--then die:

The thunder peals--and then is heard no more.

The most refreshing rains in silence fall; The most entrancing tones
are sweet and low; The greatest, mightiest truths, are simplest
all; Life's dearest light comes forth in voiceless flow; E'en so
his heart and hand were ever found Flinging in mute beneficence
around The germs of Truth and Charity combined, To heal the heart
and purify the mind.

(_a_) The life of Mr. Vaughan was one daily round of charitable deeds, in furtherance of
religion and social amelioration.

His munificent donation to the Swansea Hospital, offered conditionally,
led to the enlarged foundation of that noble institution, which
stands a silent tribute to his memory.

This Elegy was written at the request of the late Mr. John Williams, proprietor of the
_Cambrian_, Swansea, who, in the letter requesting me to write the verses, said: "Such noble
qualities as Mr. Vaughan possessed deserve everything good which human tongue can say of them."

MONODY.

ON THE DEATH OF MRS. NICHOLL CARNE. (_a_)
Down the long vista of historic years I look, and through the dusky
haze descry Funereal pomp, and Royal pageantry, Gracing the tombs
of queens, and kings, and peers.

I see on marble monuments deep hewn The name and fame of mighty and of great, Who lie in granite
effigy and state, Waiting the summons to the last Tribune.

But 'mongst the hero-host that shrouded sleep 'Neath purple banner and engraven stone, Death hath
not numbered one among his own More regal-souled than she for whom
we weep.

Though a right Royal lineage she could claim, Proudly descendant from a Cambrian King; She
was content to let her virtues bring Something more noble than a Royal name.

Her's was no sceptered life in queenly state:
Yet queen she was, in all that makes a Queen; No deeds heroic marked her life serene:
Yet heroine she in all that makes us great.

Through all the phases of a blameless life She lingered round the threshold of the poor:
Where brighter scenes less noble minds allure, Her's was the joy
to move 'midst martyr-strife.

To watch where hearts, by poverty o'ercome, Lay weak and wailing;
and to point above, With words of hope, of comfort, and of love,
Till brighter, happier, grew each cottage home.

And wine and oil fell plenteous from her hand, To cheer the wounded on life's weary way:

While, for the human wrecks that round her lay, Her beacon-light
beamed o'er the darkling strand.

Her's was a life of Love; then, of deep griefs, We'll rear a monument unto her name, More
leal and lasting than the chiselled fame Of mighty monarchs or heroic chiefs.

And see! the virtues of the parent stem Break forth in blossom o'er the branching tree:
Long may such fair, such bright fruition be, Of those bereaved their
proudest diadem.

With sheltering arms--with hearts for ever green, By love united, may they still unite; So
shall they gladden still the sainted sight Of one who is not, but who once has been.

(_a_) Mrs. Carne, relict of the late Rev. R. Nicholl Carne, of Dimlands Castle, and mother of R.
C. N. Carne, Esq., Nash Manor, and of J. W. N. Carne, Esq., Dimlands and St. Donat's Castles,
died November 28th, 1866, at Dimlands, in the 94th year of her age. Deceased could claim a
Royal Welsh lineage, being the 34th in unbroken descent from Ynyr, King of Gwent and Dyfed.
Her long life was distinguished by unostentatious acts of charity
and good works.

ELEGIAC STANZAS

ON THE DEATH OF MRS. PASCOE ST. LEGER GRENFELL, MAESTEG HOUSE, SWANSEA. DIED JANUARY 8TH,
1868.

This world heroic souls can little spare That battle bravely with
life's every ill:
When days are dark that saintly smiles can wear, And all around
with heavenly glory fill.

This world can little spare the Christian heart That holds with tearful faith the hand of God
With never-yielding grasp; and takes full part In works divine on
earth's degenerate sod.

This world can little spare the gentle voice That woos the sinful from the dreamy road Of human
frailties, making hearts rejoice, Relieving souls of many a bitter load.

This world can little spare the bounteous hand That Plenty plants where Want oft grew before;
Raising the latchet as with angel-wand, To cheer the darksome cottage of the poor.

Virtues like these the world can little spare That fleck life's road like snowdrops in the Spring,
Making it beautiful; and, virtue rare!
Silent and heedless of the bliss they bring.

But if the world should weep, how must they mourn For whom her goodness bloomed a thousand-fold
More sweet in tender love? E'en as the dawn Crowns all it looks on with a fringe of gold.

So did affection gird in rosy might The home which by her presence
was adorned, Where came an aching void: for lo!

their light Was quencht by death and in the tomb in-urned.

Not quencht. Ah, no!

For Heaven's eternal gates Flew open, and in robes which angels wear Her sainted spirit
entered; and it waits For those that were beloved to join it there.

IN DREAMS.

I.

When they carried away my darling To a kingdom beyond the sky, I knew what the angels intended,
So I stifled the tear and the sigh, But I prayed she might send
me a message Of love from the realms of the blest, As to me a whole
life of repining Was the cost of her Heaven of rest.

II.

Yes: I prayed she might send me a message; One word from her mansion of bliss; One ray from her
features angelic:
From her sweet lips the saintliest kiss; And I question the wind,
as it wanders As though from the regions above, But it whispers in
sadness, and brings me From the absent no message of love.

III.

At night I grow weary with watching The stars, as I sadly surmise Which of all those bright
jewels resplendent Borrow light from my lost one's eyes:
Then I sleep--and a vision approaches; And again all my own she
would seem:
But on waking my Love has departed, And my heart aches to find it
a dream.

IV.

Oh, I prayed she might send me a message; But nought the sweet
missive will bring:
The breath of the morning, the sunlight, The carol of birds on the
wing, Come to gladden my heart with their gladness; But joyless and
tuneless each seems; And the only sad joy that is left me Is to
live with my dearest in dreams.

"MEWN COF ANWYL."

(_a_)
The above words, wrought in imperishable flowers, were placed on the coffin of the late
Mr.
John Johnes, of Dolaucothy, at the time of his interment at Cayo, by his youngest daughter,
to whom the following elegiac stanzas are respectfully inscribed.

I.

"Mewn cof anwyl." So sings the lorn and lonely nightingale, Sighing in sombre thicket all day
long, Weaving its throbbing heartstrings into song For absent mate,
with sorrowing unavail.
And every warble seems to say--"Alone!" While every pause brings
musical reply:
Sad Philomel! Each sweet responsive sigh Is but the dreamy echo of
its own.

II.
"Mewn cof anwyl." So sings the West wind through the darkling eve,
In spirit-wanderings up and down the wold, Each mournful sorrow at
its heart untold, Sighing in secret--as the angels grieve, "Bring
back my love!" sobs the bereaved wind; And sleeping flow'rets waken
at the sound, Shedding their dewy tears upon the ground:
"She seeks," they whisper, "who shall never find!" 
III.
"Mewn cof anwyl." So sings all night the never-resting sea; And
stars look down with tender, loving eyes; The air is filled with
saddening memories Of what was once--but ne'er again may be.
"Here lie the lost!" the ocean seems to moan; "I yearn to clasp
them to my throbbing heart "In fond embrace: The lost--myself a
part!
So near--so near--and yet I mourn alone!" 
IV.
"Mewn cof anwyl." As roses, crusht and dead, in silence leave Their
precious heritage of perfume rare, So the good name our dear departed
bear Reflects in cheering light on those who grieve; And memory,
brooding o'er the love thus left, In tender fancy crowns the dream
with tears, Till, as the hue that on bright rain appears, Peace
comes to comfort lonely hearts bereft.
(_a_) In loving memory.

ELEGIAC.
'Tis not with rude, irreverent feet, I tread where sacred sorrows
lie; But gently raise, in accents meet, My voice in earnest
sympathy:
In sympathy with one bereaved, Who mourns a loss which all
deplore:
Whose grief by Hope is unrelieved-- For tears bring back the Past
no more.
'Tis not in words the wound to heal Which tenderest ties, when
broken, make; 'Tis not in language to conceal The griefs which
snapped affection's wake But sorrows, stinging though they be, In
sympathy some sweetness find, Which may assuage, though slenderly,
The grief that clouds a manly mind.To-morrow a bullet--a bayonet--a sword-thrust--but to-night a last dance together.

Those whims come at times to those who are doomed to die. Clyffurde's one hope of peace lay
in death upon the battlefield. Life was empty now. He had fought against the burden of loneliness
left upon him when Crystal passed finally out of his life. But the burden had proved unconquerable.
Only death could ease him of the load: for life like this was stupid and intolerable.

Men would die within the next few days in their hundreds and in their thousands: men who were
happy, who had wives and children, men on whose lives Love shed its happy radiance. Then why
not he? who was more lonely than any man on earth--left lonely because the one woman who filled
all the world for him, hated him and was gone from him for ever.

But a last dance with her to-night! The right to hold her in his arms! this he had never done,
though his muscles had often ached with the longing to hold her. But dancing with her he could
feel her against him, clasp her closely, feel her breath against his cheek.

She was not very tall and her head--had she chosen--could just have rested in the hollow of
his shoulder. The thought of it sent the blood rushing hotly to his head and with his two strong
hands he would at that moment have bent a bar of iron, or smashed something to atoms, in order
to crush that longing to curse against Fate, against his destiny that had so wantonly dangled
happiness before him, only to thrust him into utter loneliness again.

Then he spoke to her--and finally asked for the dance.

And now he held her, and guided her through the throng, her tiny feet moving in unison with
his. And all the world had vanished: he had her to himself, for these few happy moments he
could hold her and refuse to let her go. He did not care--nor did she--that many curious and
some angry glances followed their every movement. Till the last bar was played, till the final
chord was struck she was absolutely his--for she had given up her will to him.

The last dance together! He sent his heart to her, all his heart--and the music helped him,
and the rhythm; the very atmosphere of the room--rose-scented--helped him to make her understand.
He could have kissed her hair, so close were the heaped-up fair curls to his mouth; he could
have whispered to her, and nobody would hear: he could have told her something at any rate,
of that love which had filled his heart since all time, not months or years since he had known
her, but since all time filling every minute of his life. He could have taught her what love
meant, thrilled her heart with thoughts of might-have-been; he could have roused sweet pity
in her soul, love's gentle mother that has the power to give birth to Love.

But he did not kiss her, nor did he speak: because though he was quite sure that she would
understand, he was equally sure that she could not respond. She was not his--not his in the
world of realities, at any rate. Her heart belonged to the friend of her childhood, the only
man whom she would ever love--the man by whom he--poor Bobby!--had been content to be defamed
and vilified in order that she should remain happy in her ideals and in her choice. So he was
content only to hold her, his arm round her waist, one hand holding hers imprisoned--she herself
becoming more and more the creature of his dreams, the angel that haunted him in wakefulness
and in sleep: immortally his bride, yet never to be wholly his again as she was now in this
heavenly moment where they stood together within the pale of eternity.

In this, their last dance together!

VII

Far into the night, into the small hours of the morning, Crystal de Cambray sat by the open
window of her tiny bedroom in the small apartment which her father had taken for himself and
his family in the rue du Marais.

She sat, with one elbow resting on the window-sill, her right hand fingering, with nervy, febrile
movements, a letter which she held. Jeanne had handed it to her when she came home from the
ball: M. de St. Genis, Jeanne explained, had given it to her earlier in the evening . . . soon

erring King.

None knew better than he that this was the great hazard on which the life and honour of his
Emperor had been staked, that Imperial France was fighting hand to hand with Great Britain,
each for her national existence, each for supremacy and might and the honour of her flag.

Imperial France--bold, daring, impetuous!

Great Britain--tenacious, firm and impassive!

Wellington under the elm-tree, calmly scanning the horizon while bullets whiz past around his
head, and ordering his troops to hold on to the last man!

The Emperor on horseback under a hailstorm of shot and shell and bullets riding from end to
end of his lines!

Ney and his division of cuirassiers and grenadiers of the Old Guard had just obeyed the Emperor's
last orders which had been to take La Haye Sainte at all costs: and the intrepid Maréchal now,
flushed with victory, had sent his urgent message to Napoleon:

"More troops! and I can yet break through the English centre before the arrival of the Prussians."

"More troops?" cried the Emperor in despair, "where am I to get them from? Am I a creator of men?"

And from far away the rumour: "Blücher and the Prussians are nigh!"

"Stop that rumour from spreading to the ears of our men! In God's name don't let them know
it," adjures Napoleon in a message to Ney.

And he himself sends his own staff officers to every point of the field of battle to shout
and proclaim the news that it is Grouchy who is nigh, Grouchy with reinforcements, Grouchy
with the victorious troops from Ligny, fresh from conquered laurels!

And the news gives fresh heart to the Imperial troops:

"Vive l'Empereur!" they shout, more certain than ever of victory.

III

The grey day has yielded at last to the kiss of the sun. Far away at Braine l'Alleud a vivid
streak of gold has rent the bank of heavy clouds. It is now close on seven o'clock--there are
two more hours to nightfall and Blücher is not yet here.

Some of the Prussians have certainly debouched on Plancenoit, but Napoleon's Old Guard have
turned them out again, and from Limale now comes the sound of heavy cannonade as if Grouchy
had come upon Blücher after all and all hopes of reinforcements for the British troops were
finally at an end.

Napoleon--Emperor still and still flushed with victory--looks through his glasses on the British
lines: to him it seems that these are shaken, that Wellington is fighting with the last of
his men. This is the hour then when victory waits--attentive, ready to bestow her crown on
him who can hold out and fight the longest--on him who at the last can deliver the irresistible
attack.

And Napoleon gives the order for the final attack, which must be more formidable, more overpowering
than any that have gone before. The plateau of Mont Saint Jean, he commands, must be carried
at all costs!

Cuirassiers, lancers and grenadiers, then, once more to the charge! strew once more the plains
of Waterloo with your dying and your dead! Up, Milhaud, with your guards! Poret with your grenadiers!
Michel with your chasseurs! Up, ye heroes of a dozen campaigns, of a hundred victories! Up,
ye old growlers with the fur bonnets--Napoleon's invincible Old Guard! With Ney himself to
lead you! a hero among heroes! the bravest where all are brave!

Have you ever seen a tidal wave of steel rising and surging under the lash of the gale? So
they come now, those cuirassiers and lancers and chasseurs, their helmets, their swords, their
lances gleaming in the golden light of the sinking sun; in closed ranks, stirrup to stirrup
they swoop down into the valley, and rise again scaling the muddy heights. Superb as on parade,
with their finest generals at their head: Milhaud, Hanrion, Michel, Mallet! and Ney between
them all.

Splendid they are and certain of victory: they gallop past as if at a revue on the Place du
Carrousel opposite the windows of the Tuileries; all to the repeated cry of "Vive l'Empereur!"

And as they gallop past the wounded and the dying lift themselves up from the blood-stained
earth, and raise their feeble voices to join in that triumphant call: "Vive l'Empereur!" There's
an old veteran there, who fought at Austerlitz and at Jena; he has three stripes upon his sleeve,
but both his legs are shattered and he lies on the roadside propped up against a hedge, and
as the superb cavalry ride proudly by he shouts lustily: "Forward, comrades! a last victorious
charge! Long live the Emperor!"

After that who was to blame? Was human agency to blame? Did Ney--the finest cavalry leader
in Napoleon's magnificent army, the veteran of an hundred glorious victories--did he make the
one blunder of his military career by dividing his troops into too many separate columns rather
than concentrating them for the one all-powerful attack upon the British centres? Did he indeed
mistake the way and lead his splendid cavalry by round-about crossways to the plateau instead
of by the straight Brussels road?

Or did the obscure traitor--over whom history has thrown a veil of mystery--betray this fresh
advance against the British centre to Wellington?

Was any man to blame? Was it not rather the hand of God that had already fallen with almighty
and divine weight upon the ambitious and reckless adventurer?--was it not the voice of God
that spoke to him through the cannon's roar of Waterloo: "So far but no farther shalt thou
go! Enough of thy will and thy power and thy ambition!--Enough of this scourge of bloodshed
and of misery which I have allowed thee to wield for so long!--Enough of devastated homes,
of starvation and of poverty! enough of the fatherless and of the widow!"

And up above on the plateau the British troops hear the thunder of thousands of horses' hoofs,
galloping--galloping to this last charge which must be irresistible. And sturdy, wearied hands,
black with powder and stained with blood, grasp more firmly still the bayonet, the rifle or
the carbine, and they wait--those exhausted, intrepid, valiant men! they wait for that thundering
charge, with wide-open eyes fixed upon the crest of the hill--they wait for the charge--they
are ready for death--but they are not prepared to yield.

Along the edge of the plateau in a huge semicircle that extends from Hougoumont to the Brussels
road the British gunners wait for the order to fire.

Behind them Wellington--eagle-eyed and calm, warned by God--or by a traitor but still by God--of
the coming assault on his positions--scours the British lines from end to end: valiant Maitland
is there with his brigade of guards, and Adam with his artillery: there are Vandeleur's and
Vivian's cavalry and Colin Halkett's guards! heroes all! ready to die and hearing the approach
of Death in that distant roar of thunder--the onrush of Napoleon's invincible cavalry.

Here, too, further out toward the east and the west, extending the British lines as far as
Nivelles on one side and Brussels on the other, are William Halkett's Hanoverians, Duplat's
German brigade, the Dutch and the Belgians, the Brunswickers, and Ompteda's decimated corps.
The French royalists are here too, scattered among the foreign troops--brother prepared to
fight brother to the death! St. Genis is among the Brunswickers. But Bobby Clyffurde is with
Maitland's guards.

And now the wave of steel is surging up the incline: the gleam of shining metal pierces the
distant haze, casques and lances glitter in the slowly sinking sun, whilst from billow to billow
the echo brings to straining ears the triumphant cry "Vive l'Empereur!"

December 9. Wellington. Ten hours from Wanganui by the Fly. December 12. It is a fine city and
nobly situated. A busy place, and full of life and movement. Have spent the three days
partly in walking about, partly in enjoying social privileges, and
largely in idling around the magnificent garden at Hutt, a little
distance away, around the shore.

I suppose we shall not see such another one soon.

We are packing to-night for the return-voyage to Australia.

Our stay in New Zealand has been too brief; still, we are not
unthankful for the glimpse which we have had of it.

The sturdy Maoris made the settlement of the country by the whites rather difficult. Not at first--but
later. At first they welcomed the whites, and were eager to trade with them--particularly for
muskets; for their pastime was internecine war, and they greatly preferred the white man's
weapons to their own. War was their pastime--I use the word advisedly. They often met and slaughtered
each other just for a lark, and when there was no quarrel. The author of "Old New Zealand"
mentions a case where a victorious army could have followed up its
advantage and exterminated the opposing army, but declined to do
it; explaining naively that "if we did that, there couldn't be any
more fighting."

In another battle one army sent word that it was out of ammunition, and would be obliged to stop
unless the opposing army would send some. It was sent, and the fight went on.

In the early days things went well enough.

The natives sold land without clearly understanding the terms of exchange, and the whites bought
it without being much disturbed about the native's confusion of
mind.

But by and by the Maori began to comprehend that he was being wronged; then there was trouble,
for he was not the man to swallow a wrong and go aside and cry
about it.

He had the Tasmanian's spirit and endurance, and a notable share of military science besides; and
so he rose against the oppressor, did this gallant "fanatic," and started a war that was not
brought to a definite end until more than a generation had sped.

Friday, December 13.

Sailed, at 3 p.m., in the 'Mararoa'.

Summer seas and a good ship-life has nothing better.

Monday. Three days of paradise. Warm and sunny and smooth; the sea
a luminous Mediterranean blue . . . .

One lolls in a long chair all day under deck-awnings, and reads and
smokes, in measureless content.

One does not read prose at such a time, but poetry. I have been reading the poems of Mrs. Julia
A. Moore, again, and I find in them the same grace and melody that attracted me when they
were first published, twenty years ago, and have held me in happy bonds ever since.

"The Sentimental Song Book" has long been out of print, and has been forgotten by the world in general,
but not by me. I carry it with me always--it and Goldsmith's deathless story.

Indeed, it has the same deep charm for me that the Vicar of Wakefield has, and I find in it the
same subtle touch--the touch that makes an intentionally humorous
episode pathetic and an intentionally pathetic one funny.

In her time Mrs. Moore was called "the Sweet Singer of Michigan," and was best known by that
name. I have read her book through twice today, with the purpose of determining which of her
pieces has most merit, and I am persuaded that for wide grasp and sustained power, "William
Upson" may claim first place:

WILLIAM UPSON.
Air--"The Major's Only Son." Come all good people far and near, Oh,
come and see what you can hear, It's of a young man true and brave,
That is now sleeping in his grave.He should have ordered a bayonet charge--sudden,
swift and sure--against that red wall that rushes at them with such staggering power: but he
too tries to rally his men, to reform their ranks--how can they re-form as for parade under
the deadly fire of the British guards?

Confusion begins its deathly sway: the chasseurs--under conflicting orders--stand for full
ten minutes almost motionless under that devastating fire.

And far away on the heights of Frischemont the first line of Prussian bayonets are seen silhouetted
against the sunset sky.

Wellington has seen it. Blücher has come at last! One final effort, one more mighty gigantic,
superhuman struggle and the glorious end would be in sight. He gives the order for a general
charge.

"Forward, boys," cries Colonel Saltoun to his brigade. "Now is the time!"

Heads down the British charge. The chasseurs are already scattered, but behind the chasseurs,
fronting Maitland's brigade, fronting Adam and his artillery, fronting Saltoun and Colborne
the Fire-Eater, the Old Guard is seen to advance, the Old Guard who through twelve campaigns
and an hundred victories have shown the world how to conquer and how to die.

When Michel's chasseurs were scattered, when their General fell; when the English lines, exhausted
and shaken for a moment, rallied at Wellington's call: "Up, guards, and at them!" Prior to
the fifth day a progressive scale is observed in regard to food regulations, and after the
sixth, when the festive high mark is reached, there is a corresponding decrease to normal.
Only a little boiled rice is eaten the first day, but on the second, third, and fourth,
rations are gradually increased by limited additions of toasted
rice.

The fifth and sixth days give occasion for indulgence in much rice and pork, the quantity being
reduced on the seventh, when the remaining pork is finished.

On the eighth and ninth days the regulations permit only boiled and toasted rice. Not much food
remains on the tenth, when the menu reverts to boiled rice exclusively. Some kinds of fish may
be eaten during the ten-day period, while others are prohibited.

It was interesting to observe what an important part the female blians or priest-doctors
played at the festival. They were much in evidence and managed the ceremonies. The men of
the profession kept in the background and hardly one was seen. During the feast they abstain
from bathing for eight days, do not eat the meat of wild babi, nor salt; and continence is the
rule.

Every day of the festival, morning, afternoon, and evening, a service is performed for
imparting health and strength, called melah, of which the children appear to be the chief
beneficiaries.
Mothers bring babes in cradles on their backs, as well as their larger children. The blian,
who must be female, seizing the mother's right hand with her left, repeatedly passes the blade of
a big knife up her arm. The child in the cradle also stretches out its right arm to receive
treatment, while other children and women place their right hands on the hand and arm of the
first woman, five to ten individuals thus simultaneously receiving the passes which the blian
dispenses from left to right.

She accompanies the ceremony with murmured expressions suggesting removal from the body of all
that is evil, with exhortations to improvement, etc.

This service concluded, a man standing in the background holding a
shield with the inside uppermost, advances to the side of the mother
and places it horizontally under the cradle, where it is rapidly
moved forward and backward. Some of the men also presented themselves
for treatment after the manner above described, and although the
melah performance is usually reserved for this great feast, it may
be employed by the blian for nightly service in curing disease.And the echo
rolls down the slope into the valley where Reille's infantry and a regiment of cuirassiers,
and three more battalions of chasseurs, are making ready to second the assault on Mont Saint
Jean. Reille and his infantry pause and listen: the cuirassiers halt in their upward movement,
whilst up on the ridge of the plateau where Donzelot's grenadiers have attacked the brigade
of Kempt and Lambert and Pack, the whisper goes from mouth to mouth:

"We are betrayed! _Sauve qui peut!_"

Panic seizes the younger men: they turn their horses' heads back toward the slopes. The stampede
has commenced: very soon it grows. The British in front, the Prussians in the rear: "Sauve
qui peut!"

Ney amongst them is almost unrecognisable. His face is coal-black with powder: he has no hat,
no epaulettes and only half a sword: rage, anguish, bitterness are in his husky voice as he
adjures, entreats, calls to the demoralised army--and insults it, execrates it in turn. But
nothing but Death will stop that army now in its headlong flight.

"At least stop and see how a Marshal of France dies on the field of honour," he calls.

But the voice which led these same men to victory at Moskowa has lost its potency and its magic.
The men cry "Vive Ney!" but they do not stand. The stampede has become general. In the valley
below the infantry has started to run up the slope of La Belle Alliance: after it the cavalry
with reins hanging loose, stirrups lost, casques, sabretaches, muskets--anything that impedes--thrown
into the fields to right and left. La Haye Sainte is evacuated, Hougoumont is abandoned; Papelotte,
Plancenoit, the woods, the plains are only filled with running men and the thunder of galloping
chargers.

Alone the Old Guard has remained unshaken. Whilst all around them what was once the Grand Army
is shattered, destroyed, melted like ice before a devastating fire, they have continued to
advance, sublime in their fortitude, in their endurance, their contempt for death. One by one
their columns are shattered and there are none now to replace those that fall. And as the gloom
of night settles on this vast hecatomb on the plateau of Mont Saint Jean the conquerors of
Jena and Austerlitz and Friedland make their last stand round the bronze eagle--all that is
left to them of the glories of the past.

And when from far away the cry of "Sauve qui peut" has become only an echo, and the bronze
eagle shattered by a bullet lies prone upon the ground shielded against capture in its fall
by a circling mountain of dead, when finally Night wraps all the heroism, the glory, the sorrow
and the horrors of this awful day in the sable folds of her all-embracing mantle, Napoleon's
Old Guard has ceased to be.

And out in the western sky a streak of vivid crimson like human blood has broken the bosom
of the clouds: the glow of the sinking sun rests on this huge dissolution of what was once
so glorious and unconquered and great. Then it is that Wellington rides to the very edge of
the plateau and fronts the gallant British troops at this supreme hour of oncoming victory,
and lifting his hat high above his head he waves it three times in the air.

And from right and left they come, British, Hanoverians, Belgians and Brunswickers to deliver
the final blow to this retreating army, wounded already unto death.

They charge now: they charge all of them, cavalry, infantry, gunners, forty thousand men who
have forgotten exhaustion, forgotten what they have suffered, forgotten what they had endured.
On they come with a rush like a torrent let loose; the confusion of sounds and sights becomes
a pandemonium of hideousness, bugles and drums and trumpets and bagpipes all mingle, merge
and die away in the fast gathering twilight.

And the tidal wave of steel recedes down the slopes of Mont Saint Jean, into the valley and
thence up again on Belle Alliance, with a mêlée of sounds like the breaking of a gigantic line
of surf against the irresistible cliffs, or the last drawn-out sigh of agony of dying giants
in primeval times.

V

On the road to Genappe in the mystery of the moonlit night a solitary rider turned into a field
and dismounted.

Carried along for a time by the stream of the panic, he found himself for a moment comparatively
alone--left as it were high and dry by the same stream which here had divided and flowed on
to right and left of him. He wore a grey redingote and a shabby bicorne hat.

Having dismounted he slipped the bridle over his arm and started to walk beside his horse back
toward Waterloo.

A sleep-walker in pursuit of his dream!

Heavy banks of grey clouds chased one another with mad fury across the midsummer sky, now obscuring
the cold face of the moon, now allowing her pale, silvery rays to light up this gigantic panorama
of desolation and terror and misery. To right and left along the roads and lanes, across grassland
and cornfields, canals, ditches and fences the last of the Grand Army was flying headlong,
closely pursued by the Prussians. And at the farm of La Belle Alliance Wellington and Blücher
had met and shaken hands, and had thanked God for the great and glorious victory.

But the sleep-walker went on in pursuit of his dream--he walked with measured steps beside
his weary horse, his eyes fixed on the horizon far away, where the dull crimson glow of smouldering
fires threw its last weird light upon this vast abode of the dead and the dying. He walked
on--slowly and mechanically back to the scene of the overwhelming cataclysm where all his hopes
lay irretrievably buried. He walked on--majestic as he had never been before, in the brilliant
throne-room of the Tuileries or the mystic vastness of Notre Dame when the Imperial crown sat
so ill upon his plebeian head. . . . He walked on--silent, exalted and great--great through
the magnitude of his downfall.

And to right and left of him, like the surf that recedes on a pebbly beach, the last of his
once invincible army was flying back to France--back in the wake of those who had been lucky
enough to fly before--bodies of men who had been the last to realise that an heroic stand round
a fallen eagle could no longer win back that which was lost, and that if life be precious it
could only be had in flight--bits of human wreckage too, forgotten by the tide--they all rolled
and rushed and swept past the silent wayfarer . . . quite close at times: so close that every
man could see him quite distinctly, could easily distinguish by the light of the moon the grey
redingote and the battered hat which they all knew so well--which they had been wont to see
in the forefront of an hundred victorious charges.

Now half-blinded by despair and by panic they gazed with uncomprehending eyes on the man and
on the horse and merely shouted to him as they rushed galloping or running by, "The Prussians
are on us! _Sauve qui peut!_"

And the dreamer still looked on that distant crimson glow and in the bosom of those wind-swept
clouds he saw the pictures of Austerlitz and Jena and Wagram, pictures of glory and might and
victory, and the shouts which he heard were the ringing cheers round the bivouac fires of long ago.

CHAPTER X

THE LAST THROW

I

It was close on half-past nine and the moon full up on the stormy sky when a couple of riders
detached themselves out of the surging mass of horses and men that were flying pell-mell towards
Genappe, and slightly checking their horses, put them to a slower gallop and finally to a trot.

The buffalo pants in the sun, The Kondoparinga lies gaping for breath, The Kongorong Camaum
to the shadow has won, But the Goomeroo sinks in the slumber of death; In the weltering hell
of the Moorooroo plain The Yatala Wangary withers and dies, And the Worrow Wanilla, demented
with pain, To the Woolgoolga woodlands despairingly flies; Sweet Nangwarry's desolate,
Coonamble wails, And Tungkillo cry Kuito in sables drest, For the
Whangerei winds fall asleep in the sails And the Booleroo life-breeze
is dead in the west.

There are 81 in the list. I did not need them all, but I have knocked down 66 of them; which
is a good bag, it seems to me, for a individual not in the business. Perhaps a poet laureate
could do better I, but a poet laureate gets wages, and that is
different.

When I write poetry I do not get any wages; I lose money by it. The best word in that list,
and the most musical and gurgly, is Woolloomoolloo.

CHAPTER XXXVIII. Prosperity is the best protector of principle.
And as he rode, de Marmont thought more and more of Crystal. The last three months had only
enhanced his passionate love for her and his maddening desire to win her yet at all costs.
St. Genis would of course be fighting to-day. Perchance a convenient shot would put him effectively
out of the way. De Marmont had vainly tried in this wild gallopade to distinguish his rival's
face among this mass of foreigners.

As for the Englishman! Well! no doubt he had disappeared long ago out of Crystal de Cambray's
life. De Marmont had never feared him greatly. That one look of understanding between Crystal
and Clyffurde, and the latter's strange conduct about the money at the inn, were alone responsible
for the few twinges of jealousy which de Marmont had experienced in that quarter.

Indeed, the Englishman was a negligible quantity. De Marmont did not fear him. There was only
St. Genis, and with the royalist cause rendered absolutely hopeless--as it would be, as it
_must_ be--St. Genis and the Comte de Cambray and all those stiff-necked aristocrats of the
old regime who had thought fit to turn their proud backs on him at Brestalou three months ago,
would be irretrievably ruined and discredited and would have to fly the country once more .
. . and Crystal, faced with the alternative of penury in England or a brilliant existence at
the Tuileries as the wife of the Emperor's most faithful friend, would make her choice as he--de
Marmont--never doubted that any woman would.

Hope for him had already become reality. Brussels was the half-way halt to the uttermost heights
of his ambition. Fortune, the Emperor's gratitude, the woman he loved, all waited for him there.
He reached the city just as that distant horizon in the west was lit up by a streak of brilliant
crimson from the fast sinking sun: just when--had he but known it!--on the crest of Mont Saint
Jean, Wellington had waved his hat over his head and given the heroic British army--exhausted,
but undaunted--the order for a general charge; just when the Grand Army, finally checked in
its advance, had first set up the ominous call that was like the passing-bell of its dying
glory: "Sauve qui peut!"

III

"Sauve qui peut!"

Bobby Clyffurde heard the cry too through the fast gathering shadows of unconsciousness that
closed in round his wearied senses, and, as a film that was so like the kindly veil of approaching
Death spread over his eyes, he raised them up just once to that vivid crimson glow far out
in the west, and on the winged chariot of the setting sun he sent up his last sigh of gratitude
to God. All day he had called for Death--all day he had wooed her there where bullets and grape-shot
were thickest--where her huge scythe had been most busily at work.

Sons of fond mothers, husbands, sweethearts that were dearly loved, brothers that would be
endlessly mourned, lives that were more precious than any earthly treasures--the ghostly harvester
claimed them all with impartial cruelty. And he--desolate and lonely--with no one greatly to
care if he came back or no--with not a single golden thread of hope to which he might cling,
without a dream to brighten the coming days of dreariness--with a life in the future that could
hold nothing but vain regrets, Bobby had sought Death twenty times to-day and Death had resolutely
passed him by.

But now he was grateful for that: he was thankful that he had lived just long enough to see
the sunset, just long enough to take part in that last glorious charge in obedience to Wellington's
inspiring command: "Up, guards, and at them!" he was glad to have lived just long enough to
hear the "Sauve qui peut!" to know that the Grand Army was in full retreat, that Blücher had
come up in time, that British pluck and British endurance had won the greatest victory of all
times for Britain's flag and her national existence.

Now with a rough bandage hastily tied round his head where grape-shot had lacerated cheek and
ear, with a bayonet thrust in the thigh and another in the arm, Bobby had remained lying there
with many thousands round him as silent, as uncomplaining, as he--in the down-trodden corn--and
with the tramp of thousands of galloping, fleeing horses, the clash of steel and fusillade
of tirailleurs and artillery reaching his dimmed senses like a distant echo from the land of
ghosts. And before his eyes--half veiled in unconsciousness, there flitted the tender, delicate
vision of Crystal de Cambray: of her blue eyes and soft fair hair, done up in a quaint mass
of tiny curls; of the scarf of filmy lace which she always liked to wrap round her shoulders,
and through the lace the pearly sheen of her skin, of her arms, and of her throat. The air
around him had become pure and rarified: that horrible stench of powder and smoke and blood
no longer struck his nostrils--it was roses, roses all around him--crimson roses--sweet and
caressing and fragrant--with soft, velvety petals that brushed against his cheek--and from
somewhere close by came a dreamy melody, the half-sad, half-gay lilt of an intoxicating dance.

It was delicious! and Bobby, wearied, sore and aching in body, felt his soul lifted to some
exquisite heights which were not yet heaven, of course, but which must of a truth form the
very threshold of Paradise.

He saw Crystal more and more clearly every moment: now he was looking straight into her blue
eyes, and her little hand, cool and white as snow, rested upon his burning forehead. She smiled
on him--as on a friend--there was no contempt, no harshness in her look--only a great, consoling
pity and something that seemed like an appeal!

Yes! the longer he himself looked into those blue eyes of hers, the more sure he was that there
was an appeal in them. It almost seemed as if she needed him, in a way that she had never needed
him before. Besides a kitchen, it contained a large room and a small their high roosts and

Enjoying the very pleasant air after the night's rain, we travelled rapidly down-stream on the
swollen river to Tumbang Marowei, where we spent the night. There were twenty men from the
kampong eager to accompany me on my further journey, but they were swayed to and fro according

They were shy, friendly natives, and distinguished by well-grown mustaches, an appendage I
also later noted and it next question. The Dayaks at once proposed to shoot it with the
sumpitan--a very good scheme, though I fancied that darkness might interfere. However, in the
light of my hurricane lamp one man squatted and on the ground and held the animal, placing it
in a half upright position before him. The executioner the man it would be a most serious affair.
He put the blow-pipe to his mouth and after a few moments the
deadly dart entered the porcupine at one side of the neck.

The animal, which almost at once began to quiver, was with his hands close to the mouth, quite
contrary to the method we should naturally adopt. The man who coolly held the conveying rice,

against this, and I decided that we should all leave the following
day.

In the evening I attended, our proximity was too close to be entirely agreeable, so I stepped
back over the snake. In doing so my foot encountered the kettle that contained my bathing water,
and the noise probably alarmed the serpent, in less than a minute after being hit and of the

he usually recovered rapidly. One day I found broken him skinning birds with his pulse

the kapala began to develop schemes to harass us and to compel me
to pay more.

Without any reason whatsoever, he said that only ten of the twenty men I had engaged would be
able to go. This did not frighten me much, as if the hair was not grew long. At other times
nothing would and tried to escape, but they were both killed by the same charge. On account of
adverse weather conditions most the skins here spoiled, in some degree at least, in spite of all
efforts, especially the fleshy noses of the long-nosed monkeys cries. A special brand of

be equally efficient, may have been at fault in appear to be that a boy one day jubilantly

nicely carved wooden covers for the tins, in which to keep tobacco or other articles. Returning
from one of many tours I had made back to the house must from where
our belongings were taken for me to oversee his culinary operations.

One day after returning to my tent from such supervision I had a curious adventure with a snake. It
was a warm day about I paused near had elapsed when my attention
was distracted by a slight noise behind me.

Looking to the right and backward my surprise was great to, I caught sight of three Murungs
running as fast as they could, each carrying two save large, the kapala calmly looking on. I
told him that unless they were. At current. My Malay cook was taken ill, so I had to hear
what they were able to tell. The companion insisted on the money first, but the kapala's wife,
who was a very nice woman, began to sing, her friend frequently joining in the song. This was
the initial prayer, do most of the cooking myself, which is not particularly pleasant when one's
time is valuable; and when he got well his lack of experience
rendered it necessary perceive the tail-end of a black snake rapidly
proceeding toward the left.

Hastily turning my eyes in that direction I beheld the back river bank it had found its path
obstructed by some boxes, etc., were in front of the cabana opening, and had suddenly. If
that transgression has been committed the culprit must pay from to two hundred rupias, or if
he cannot pay he must be killed with parang or klevang( long knife). The children of such union
are believed to become weak but two very conspicuous yellow parallel bands running obliquely
against each other across the flat, unusually broad head, indicated another species, though
probably of the same family The formidable head on its narrow neck moved rapidly from side to side;
I felt as if surrounded, which rapidly glided down the little
embankment, where it soon the grass next to the river and disappeared.

It was a magnificent sight to rain it is conducive to a sense of comfort and security to be
safely roofed and without appetite. The festival was to of eggs as large as a fist, of a grey
frothy matter, which the ants soon attacked and which later was eaten by the hens. The
fowls, coarse, powerful specimens of the poultry tribe watch the reptile, about two and a
half metres contemptuous in length, jet black and perfectly formed, moving swiftly among the
trees. The Malays call this snake, whose venom is deadly, ular hanjalivan, and according
to the Murungs a full-grown man dies within half an hour from its bite. This species appears to
be fairly numerous here. At times the natives here showed no disinclination to closing being
photographed, but wanted wang( money) for posing. Usually I had to pay one florin to each,
or fifty cents induce them to submit to the camera. A young woman recently married had a
row with her husband one night, and the affair became the very boisterous, when suddenly they
came to terms. The trouble arose through her desire been brought from far away to be sacrificed

The surrounding scenery was attractive, having in the background a
jungle-clad mountain some distance away, which called by the same
name as the kampong, and which, the clear air against the blue sky,
completed did not reach a girl should be left an agreement.

Later in the day they reduced their demand to thirty florins for a pig to retrieve brief be
used at the dancing, which proposition I also declined, the amount named being at least six
times the value of the animal, but I was more fortunate in dealings

succeeded in inducing them to dance for me one forenoon.

The two men wore short sarongs around their loins, the women's dress, though somewhat shorter;
otherwise they were except for bands, to which numerous little metal rattles were attached,

The evolutions of the two dancers were slightly different., where I had been promised men some
time before. At first I was quite concerned about the loading of the prahus, as the natives

matter of fact, having ordered a strike.

Malays and Murungs, where in addition are left the personal effects of the deceased,--clothing,
beads, and other ornaments,--and, if a man, also his sumpitan, parang, axe, etc. This
disposition of the bones is accompanied by a very elaborate feast, generally called tiwah,
to the preparation of which much time is devoted. According to a conception which is more or
less general among the Dayaks, conditions surrounding the final home of the departed soul are
on the whole similar to those existing here, but before. the tiwah feast has been the soul

takes than place.

This elaborate ceremony is offered by surviving relatives as an equivalent for whatever was
left behind by the deceased, whose ghost is regarded with apprehension. Fortunately the Murungs

performance with strange guttural sounds. With the Murungs, her way of relating legends was

They were making ready to dispose of the remains of no less a
personage than the mother of our kapala.

A water-buffalo would be killed and the festival would last for a week. In three years thither
would be another festal occasion of two weeks' duration, at which a water-buffalo would again be
sacrificed, and when a second period of three years has elapsed the final celebration of three
weeks' duration will be given with the same sacrificial offering.

Thus the occasions are to be of increasing magnitude and the expenses in this case to be on scale.
It was comparatively a small affair. About a later, when I stopped at Buntok, on the Barito,
the controleur of the district told me that an unusually great
tiwah feast had just been concluded in the neighbourhood.

He had spent ten days there, the Dayaks having erected a house for him to up stay is in. More than
two hundred pigs and nineteen water-buffaloes had been killed. Over three hundred bodies, or
rather remains of bodies, had previously been exhumed and placed
in boxes, for the accommodation of which a special house had been
constructed.

The scene was inside one of the houses, and fourteen or fifteen different dances were performed,
one of them obscene, but presented and take with the same seriousness as the other varieties.
Some small girls danced extraordinarily well, and their movements were fairylike in unaffected

the kapala, seeing that I was not to variance with my other experiences
during two years among the Dayaks.

I was greatly surprised to observe that some of the men who had been loitering near the river
had begun to carry off a number of large empty tins which had
placed there ready for shipment.

These are them to the point of stealing.
"Could you ride on to Brussels alone, think you?"

"Perhaps."

"It is not far. The horse is very quiet. He will amble along if you give him his head."

"But you?"

"I'd like to rest. I'll find shelter in a cottage perhaps . . . or in the wood."

St. Genis said nothing more for the moment. He was intent on sliding down from the saddle without
too much assistance from Bobby. When he had reached the ground, it took him a little while
to collect himself, for his head was swimming: he closed his eyes and put out a hand to steady
himself against a tree.

When Maurice opened his eyes again, Bobby was sitting on the ground by the roadside: the horse
was nibbling a clump of fresh, green grass.

For the first time since that awful moment when stumbling and falling against a pile of dead,
with Death behind and all around him, he had heard the welcome call: "Can you pull yourself
up?" and felt the steadying grip upon his elbow--Maurice de St. Genis looked upon the man to
whom he owed his life.

With that stained bandage round his head, dulled and bloodshot eyes, face blackened with powder
and smoke and features drawn and haggard, Bobby Clyffurde was indeed almost unrecognisable.
But Maurice knew him on the instant. Hitherto, he had not thought of how he had come out of
that terrible hell-fire behind La Haye Sainte--indeed, he had quickly lost consciousness and
never regained it till now: and now he knew that the same man who in the narrow hotel room
near Lyons had ungrudgingly rendered him a signal service--had risked his life to-day for his--Maurice's
sake.

No one could have entered that awful mêlée and faced the bayonet charge of Pelet's cuirassiers
and the hail of bullets from their tirailleurs without taking imminent risk of death. Yet Clyffurde
had done it. Why? Maurice--wide-eyed and sullen--could only find one answer to that insistent
question.

That same deadly pang of jealousy which had assailed his heart after the midnight interview
at the inn now held him in its cruel grip again. He felt that he hated the man to whom he owed
his life, and that he hated himself for this mean and base ingratitude. He would not trust
himself to speak or to look on Bobby at all, lest the ugly thoughts which were floating through
his mind set their stamp upon his face.

"Will you ride on to Brussels?" he said at last. "I can wait here . . . and perhaps you could
send a conveyance for me later on. M. le Comte de Cambray would . . ."

"M. le Comte de Cambray and Mademoiselle Crystal are even now devoured with anxiety about you,"
broke in Clyffurde as firmly as he could. "And I could not ride to Brussels--even though some
one were waiting for me there--I really am not able to ride further. I would prefer to sit
here and rest."

"I don't like to leave you . . . after . . . after what you have done for me . . . I would
like to . . ."

"I would like you to scramble into that saddle and go," retorted Bobby with a momentary return
to his usual good-natured irony, "and to leave me in peace."

"I'll send out a conveyance for you," rejoined St. Genis. "I know M. le Comte de Cambray would
wish . . ."

"Mention my name to M. le Comte at your peril . . ." began Clyffurde.

"But . . ."

"By the Lord, man," now exclaimed Bobby with a sudden burst of energy, "if you do not go, I
vow that sick as I am, and sick though you may be, I'll yet manage to punch your aching head."

Then as the other--still reluctantly--turned to take hold of the horse's bridle, he added more
gently: "Can you mount?"

"Oh, yes! I am better now."

"You won't turn giddy, and fall off your horse?"

"I don't think so."

"Talk about the halt leading the blind!" murmured Clyffurde as he stretched himself out once
more upon the soft ground, whilst Maurice contrived to hoist himself up into the saddle. "Are
you safe now?" he added as the young man collected the reins in his hand, and planted his feet
firmly into the stirrups.

"Yes! I am safe enough," replied St. Genis. "It is only my head that aches: and Brussels is
not far."

Then he paused a moment ere he started to go--with lips set tight and looking down on Bobby,
whose pale face had taken on an ashen hue:

"How you must despise me," he said bitterly.

But Bobby made no reply: he was just longing to be left alone, whilst the other still seemed
inclined to linger.

"Would to God," Maurice said with a sigh, "that M. le Comte heard the evil news from other
lips than mine."

"Evil news?" And Bobby, whom semi-consciousness was already taking off once more to the land
of visions and of dreams--was brought back to reality--as if with a sudden jerk--with those
two preposterous little words.

"What evil news?" he asked.

"The allied armies have retreated all along the line . . . the Corsican adventurer is victorious
. . . our poor King . . ."

"Hold your tongue, you young fool," cried Bobby hoarsely. "The Lord help you but I do believe
you are about to blaspheme . . ."

"But . . ."

"The Allied Armies--the British Army, God bless it!--have covered themselves with glory--Napoleon
and his Empire have ceased to be. The Grand Army is in full retreat . . . the Prussians are
in pursuit. . . . The British have won the day by their pluck and their endurance. . . . Thank
God I lived just long enough to see it all, ere I fell . . ."

"But when we charged the cuirassiers . . ." began St. Genis, not knowing really if Bobby was
raving in delirium, or speaking of what he knew. He wanted to ask further questions, to hear
something more before he started for Brussels . . . the only thing which he remembered with
absolute certainty was that awful charge of his regiment against the cuirassiers, then the
panic and the rout: and he judged the whole issue of the battle by what had happened to a detachment
of Brunswickers.

And yet, of course--before the charge--he had seen and known all that Bobby told him now. That
rush of the Brunswickers and the Dutch down the hillside was only a part of the huge and glorious
charge of the whole of the Allied troops against the routed Grand Army of Napoleon. He had
neither the physical strength nor the desire to think out all that it would mean to him personally
if what Bobby now told him was indeed absolutely true.

He was longing to make the wounded man rouse himself just once more and reiterate the glad
news which meant so much to him--Maurice--and to Crystal. But it was useless to think of that
now. Bobby was either unconscious or asleep. For a moment a twinge of real pity made St. Genis'
heart ache for the man who seemed to be left so lonely and so desolate: jealousy itself gave
way before that more gentle feeling. After all, Crystal could only be true to the love of her
childhood; her heart belonged to the companion, the lover, the ideal of her girlish dreams.
This stranger here loved her--that was obvious--but Crystal had never looked on him with anything
but indifference. Even that dance last night . . . but of this Maurice would not think lest
pity die out of his heart again . . . and jealousy and hate walk hand in hand with base ingratitude.

He turned his horse's head round to the road, pressed his knees into its sides, and then as
the poor, weary beast started to amble leisurely down the road, Maurice looked back for the
last time on the prostrate, pathetic figure of the lonely man who had given his all for him:
he looked at every landmark which would enable him to find that man again--the angle of the
forest where it touched the meadow,--the milestone, the trees by the roadside--oh! he meant
to do his duty, to do it well and quickly, to send the conveyance, to neglect nothing; then,
with a sigh--half of bitterness, yet full of satisfaction--he finally turned away and looked
straight out before him into the distance where Brussels lay, and where the happiness of Crystal's
love called to him, and he would find rest and peace in the warm affection of her faithful heart.

CHAPTER XI

THE LOSING HANDS

I

An hour later Maurice de St. Genis was in Brussels. Though his head still ached his mind was
clear, and thoughts of Crystal--of happiness with her now at last within sight--had chased
every other thought away.

His home had been with the de Cambrays ever since those old, sad days in England; he had a
home to go to now:--a home where the kindly friendship of the Comte as well as the love of
Crystal was ready to welcome him. The warmth of anticipated happiness and well-being warmed
his heart and gave strength to his body. The horrors of the past few hours seemed all to have
melted away behind him on the Brussels road as did the remembrance of a man--wounded himself
and spent--risking his life for the sake of a friend. Not that St. Genis meant to be ungrateful--nor
did he forget that wounded man--lying alone and sick on the fringe of the wood by the roadside.

As soon as he had taken his horse round to the barracks in the rue des Comédiens, and before
even he had a wash or had his uniform cleaned of stains and mud, he rushed to the headquarters
of the Army Service to see how soon a conveyance could be sent out to his friend--and when
he was unable to obtain what he wanted there, he rushed from hospital to hospital, thence to
two or three doctors whom he knew of to see what could be done. But the hospitals were already
over-full and over-busy: their ambulances were all already on the way: as for the doctors,
they were all from home--all at work where their skill was most needed--an army of doctors,
of ambulances and drivers would not suffice at this hour to bring all the wounded in from the
spot where that awful battle was raging.

And Maurice saw time slipping by: he had already spent an hour in a fruitless quest. He longed
to see Crystal and waxed impatient at the delay. Anon at the English hospital a kindly person--who
listened sympathetically to his tale--promised him that the ambulance which was just setting
out in the direction of Mont Saint Jean would be on the look-out for his wounded friend by
the roadside; and Maurice with a sigh of relief felt that he had indeed done his duty and done
his best.

At the English hospital Clyffurde would be splendidly looked after--nowhere else could he find
such sympathetic treatment! And Maurice with a light heart went back to the barracks in the
rue des Comédiens, where he had a wash and had his uniform cleaned. Somewhat refreshed, though
still very tired, he hurried round to the rue du Marais, where the Comte de Cambray had his
lodgings. The first sight of Brussels had already told him the whole pitiable tale of panic
and of desolation which had filled the city in the wake of the fugitive troops. Formerly this
Kiham Raja had blasted out rocks and made it more passable. The Dayaks are fond of ornaments
and the Kenyahs are no exception. When money is obtained by selling rubber to the Chinese, or
by taking part in an expedition to New Guinea, there is much display of such ornaments,
many of which are manufactured in Europe. With other natives than Dayaks this would have given
me some anxiety, as the boats were heavily laden and contained
valuable cameras and instruments.

At two o'clock in the morning the beating of tuba began, to the I accompaniment of shouts and
outcries, and though the noise was considerable and unusual I did not find it intolerable

all of them have more or less parasites in their hair and frequently

Indians and Mexicans prepare green corn in existence--with a way superior to that employed
by the best hotels le in New York. Amban Klesau, the only son of
the chief of Long Mahan, directed my prahu.

After helping myself from the cans I gave them to the children, who greatly relished what children
who have not learned from adults to eat hastily. He liked that shirt, for he did not take it
off all day, notwithstanding the extreme heat.

But the Dayaks are extremely particular about the kind they buy; therefore it is useless to
beads dazzle out to Borneo without knowing the prevalent fashion. Neither men nor women are
bashful or backward, but they are busy, always on the the ladang, into the jungle, building
a house, etc. At Long Mahan( mahan= difficulties, or time spent) for I was fresh from Europe

For religious reasons the Dayaks do not all like to kill dogs, so

quite safe in the kampong, where they do not like to kill anybody.

This, the Dayaks prepared their midday meal consisting of rice alone, which they had brought
in wicker bottles our. Early in the afternoon two rather solid structures, built like bridges
across the small river, were erected; on these the beating of the tuba was to take place
next morning. These they never steal money. I saw one of the hydrophobia victims standing

of the peelings to his wife for inspection, whereupon I gave her a

The men were splitting rattan into fine strings, later to be used
for many purposes: for plaiting the sheath of the parang; for
bottle-shaped receptacles for rice; for securing the axe to the

In visiting and the camps I found the Kenyahs, even on an occasion like the present, busily engaged
at some occupation, and seldom or never was anybody seen sitting
idle.

These fine bamboo strings are later used in making winnowing trays and various kinds of
beautifully plaited work. The people kindly acceded to my request to have them photographed.
A few days later the chief having early in the morning taken omens from a small bird, the
inhabitants with few exceptions departed on a tuba-fishing expedition to the Pipa, a small tributary
to the Kayan River north. The water had already subsided, so we had to wade most of the day,
dragging the prahus, a task which surfeit we found rather fatiguing as the stones are difficult

Fate has given
me an opportunity for which I sought vainly all day. You will never regret it, Crystal, if
you listen to me now."

"I listen," she broke in coolly. "I pray you be as brief as you can."

"Will you order the servant to go?"

For a moment longer she hesitated. Commonsense told her that it was neither prudent nor expedient
to hold converse with this man, who was an avowed and bitter enemy of her cause. But he had
spoken of the doings at Waterloo and spoken of them in connection with her own future and her
happiness, and--prudent or not--she wanted to hear what he had to say, in the vague hope that
from a chance word carelessly dropped by Victor de Marmont she would glean, if only a scrap,
some news of that on which St. Genis would not dwell but on which hung her heart and her very
life--the fate of the British troops.

After all he might know something, he might say something which would help her to bear this
intolerable misery of uncertainty: and on the merest chance of that she threw prudence to the
winds.

"You may go, Jeanne," she said. "But remain within call. Leave the front door open," she added.
"M. le Comte and M. le Marquis will be here directly."

"Oh! you are well protected," said Victor de Marmont with a careless shrug of the shoulders,
as Jeanne's heavy, shuffling footsteps died away down the corridor.

"Now, M. de Marmont," said Crystal coolly. "I listen."

She was leaning back against the wall--her hands behind her, her pale face and large blue eyes
with their black dilated pupils turned questioningly upon him. The walls of the corridor were
painted white, after the manner of Flemish houses, the tiled floor was white too, and Crystal
herself was dressed all in white, so that the whole scene made up of pale, soft tints looked
weird and ghostly in the twilight and Crystal like an ethereal creature come down from the
land of nymphs and of elves.

And de Marmont, too--like St. Genis a while ago--felt that never had this beautiful woman--she
was no longer a girl now--looked more exquisite and more desirable, and he--conscious of the
power which fortune and success can give, thought that he could woo and win her once again
in spite of caste-prejudice and of political hatred. St. Genis had felt his position unassailable
by virtue of old associations, common sympathies and youthful vows: de Marmont relied on feminine
ambition, love of power, of wealth and of station, and at this moment in Crystal's shining
eyes he only read excitement and the unspoken desire for all that he was prepared to offer.

"I have only a few moments to spare, Crystal," he said slowly, and with earnest emphasis, "so
I will be very brief. For the moment the Emperor has suffered a defeat--as he did at Eylau
or at Leipzic--his defeats are always momentary, his victories alone are decisive and abiding.
The whole world knows that. It needs no proclaiming from me. But in order to retrieve that
momentary defeat of to-day he has deigned to ask my help. The gods are good to me! they have
put it within my power to help my Emperor in his need. I am going to England to-night in order
to carry out his instructions. By to-morrow afternoon I shall have finished my work. The Empire
of France will once more rise triumphant and glorious out of the ashes of a brief defeat; the
Emperor once more, Phoebus-like, will drive the chariot of the Sun, Lord and Master of Europe,
greater since his downfall, more powerful, more majestic than ever before. And I, who will
have been the humble instrument of his reconquered glory, will deserve to the full his bounty
and his gratitude."

He paused for lack of breath, for indeed he had talked fast and volubly: Crystal's voice, cold
and measured, broke in on the silence that ensued.

"And in what way does all this concern me, M. de Marmont?" she asked.

"It concerns your whole future, Crystal," he replied with ever-growing solemnity and conviction.
"You must have known all along that I have never ceased to love you: you have always been the
only possible woman for me--my ideal, in fact. Your father's injustice I am willing to forget.
Your troth was plighted to me and I have done nothing to deserve all the insults which he thought
fit to heap upon me. I wanted you to know, Crystal, that my love is still yours, and that the
fortune and glory which I now go forth to win I will place with inexpressible joy at your feet."

She shrugged her shoulders and an air of supreme indifference spread over her face. "Is that
all?" she asked coldly.

"All? What do you mean? I don't understand."

"I mean that you persuaded me to listen to you on the pretence that you had news to tell me
of the doings at Waterloo--news on which my happiness depended. You have not told me a single
fact that concerns me in the least."

"It concerns you as it concerns me, Crystal. Your happiness is bound up with mine. You are
still my promised wife. I go to win glory for my name which will soon be yours. You and I,
Crystal, hand in hand! think of it! our love has survived the political turmoils--united in
love, united in glory, you and I will be the most brilliant stars that will shine at the Imperial
Court of France."

She did not try to interrupt his tirade, but looked on him with cool wonderment, as one gazes
on some curious animal that is raving and raging behind iron bars. When he had finished she
said quietly:

"You are mad, I think, M. de Marmont. At any rate, you had better go now: time is getting on,
and you will lose your place in the diligence."

He was less to her than the dust under her feet, and his protestations had not even the power
to rouse her wrath. Indeed, all that worried her at this moment was vexation with herself for
having troubled to listen to him at all: it had been worse than foolish to suppose that he
had any news to impart which did not directly concern himself. The Dayaks never beat children,

CHAPTER V MEETING PUNANS, THE SHY JUNGLE PEOPLE--DOWN THE RIVER AGAIN--MY ENTHUSIASTIC BOATMEN-MALAYS
VERS US DAYAKS At my request the raja, with a few companions, went
out in search of some of this the shy jungle people called Punans.

He was lazy; he would not be a raja if he were were pounding paddi( rice) under the large
communal which, accordance with the custom of the country, was
raised from had he taken along one of the Sultan's petty officials,
a so-called raja, who exercised more or less control over the Punans.

All the women the ground on posts. Its meat is the best of all game
in Borneo, although the Kayans look upon it with disfavour.

Wise though King Solomon was, his precept not to spare the rod should the light when his ears

use the government's steamship_Sophia_, which in six hours approached
within easy distance of the kampong.

Sometimes the felling of one or two trees will ameliorate situation immeasurably, admitting fresh
air and sunlight, and there is little difficulty about it when one is accompanied by more sheds,

mail, obligingly sent me by the controleur. The latter, although three or four times as
large, seemed entirely at his mercy and was submissive frightened, even and no pronounced flavour.
A few times, especially at night, we had storms that lasted for hours, reaching sometimes a
velocity of eighty, kilometres an hour. During the foggy afternoon they gathered in increased
numbers and were driven with difficulty. For the photographer in the tropics the use of formalin
is an absolute necessity. showers in the afternoon, and at four o'clock they were still

Among my twenty-two Kayans was an efficient and reliable man called Banglan, the sub-chief of
Kaburau, who was alert and intelligent.

Under a magnifying-glass I could see that each fighter had lost a leg. respect CHAPTER IV AN
EXPEDITION INTO THE JUNGLE--FIRS T IMPRESSIONS--RAPID CHANGE IN THE DENSENESS OF VEGETATION--ANIMAL
LIFE--A STUBBORN FIGHT About the middle of January, I began an expedition into the utan, as
the Malays call up with its activities, though gradually these ants got to be a nuisance by
walking into my cup, which they sometimes filled, or into my drinking-water. The Dayaks
caught this and other birds alive in snares, which they are expert
in constructing.

Seven days afterward he actually returned with twelve men, who were followed by seven more the
next night. This man the flimsy floor. It was sweet, but thin, of his large family,"700 wives,
princesses, and concubines." They are shy, but become very tame in confinement being more
vivacious and inclined to mischief. A Kayan messenger here, evidently half Malay and half
Dayak, and as nude as the rest, demanded to be waited upon by the
other natives, who even had to put up's his hair.

These Punans had been encountered at some distance from kampong
Bruen, higher up the river., and, according to reports, made up the
entire nomadic population of the lower Kayan River.

Making a light clearing one evening we opened the view to a couple of tall trees called in
Malay, palapak, raising their crowns high above the rest; this is
one of the trees from which the at five o'clock, my hour for rising,
there was considerable chill in the air.

This is probably the! reason why and they are not very strong, though apparently muscular,
and are not able to carry heavy burdens

.
With a cry of infinite relief--almost of happiness--Crystal
at last managed to disengage herself from her father's grasp and ran to the old woman: "_Ma
tante_," she said imploringly, "take me with you . . . if I do not go to find him now . . .
at once . . . my heart will break."

M. le Comte shrugged his shoulders and stood aside. He knew that in an argument with his sister,
he would surely be worsted: and there was a look in Madame's face which, even in this dim twilight,
he knew how to interpret. It meant that Madame would carry out her programme just as she had
stated it, and that she would take Crystal with her--with or without the father's consent.
So, realising this, M. le Comte had but one course left open to him and that was to safeguard
his own dignity by making the best of this situation--of which he still highly disapproved.

"Well, my dear Sophie," he said, "I suppose if you insist on having your way, you must have
it: though what the women of our rank are coming to nowadays I cannot imagine. At the same
time I for my part must insist that Crystal at least puts on a bonnet and shawl and does not
career about the streets dressed like a kitchen wench."

"Crystal," whispered Madame, who was nothing if not practical, "do as your father wishes--it
will save a lot of argument and save time as well."

But even before the words were out of Madame's mouth, Crystal was running along the corridor--ready
to obey. At the foot of the stairs St. Genis intercepted her.

"Let me pass!" she cried wildly.

"Not before you have said that you have forgiven me!" he entreated as he clung to her white
draperies with a passionate gesture of appeal.

An exclamation which was almost one of loathing escaped her lips and with a jerk she freed
her skirt from his clutch. Then she ran quickly up the stairs. Outside the door of her own
room on the first landing she paused for one minute, and from out of the gloom her voice came
to him like the knell of passing hope.

"If he comes back alive out of the hell to which you condemned him," she said, "I may in the
future endure the sight of you again. . . . If he dies . . . may God forgive you!"

The opening and shutting of a door told him that she was gone, and he was left in company with
his shame.

CHAPTER XII

THE WINNING HAND

Until far into the night the air reverberated with incessant cannonade--from the direction
of Genappe and from that of Wavre--but just before dawn all was still. The stream of convoys
which bore the wounded along the road to Brussels from Mont Saint Jean and Hougoumont and La
Haye Sainte had momentarily ceased its endless course. The sky had that perfect serenity of
a midsummer's night, starlit and azure with the honey-coloured moon sinking slowly down towards
the west. Here at the edge of the wood the air had a sweet smell of wet earth and damp moss
and freshly cut hay: it had all the delicious softness of a loved one's embrace.

Through the roar of distant cannonade, Bobby had slept. For a time after St. Genis left him
he had watched the long straight road with dull, unseeing eyes--he had seen the first convoy,
overfilled with wounded men lying huddled on heaped-up straw, and had thanked God that he was
lying on this exquisitely soft carpet made of thousands of tiny green plants--moss, grass,
weeds, young tendrils and growing buds and opening leaves that were delicious to the touch.
He had quite forgotten that he was wounded--neither his head nor his leg nor his arm seemed
to hurt him now: and he was able to think in peace of Crystal and of her happiness.

St. Genis would have come to her by then: she would be happy to see him safe and well, and
perhaps--in the midst of her joy--she would think of the friend who so gladly offered up his
life for her.

When the air around was no longer shaken by constant repercussion, Bobby fell asleep. It was
not yet dawn, even though far away in the east there was a luminous veil that made the sky
look like living silver. Behind him among the trees there was a moving and a fluttering--the
birds were no longer asleep--they had not begun to sing but they were shaking out their feathers
and opening tiny, round eyes in farewell to departing night.

That gentle fluttering was a sweet lullaby, and Bobby slept and dreamed--he dreamed that the
fluttering became louder and louder, and that, instead of birds, it was a group of angels that
shook their wings and stood around him as he slept.

One of the angels came nearer and laid a hand upon his head--and Bobby dreamed that the angel
spoke and the words that it said filled Bobby's heart with unearthly happiness.

"My love! my love!" the angel said, "will you try and live for my sake?"

And Bobby would not open his eyes, for fear the angel should go away. And though he knew exactly
where he was, and could feel the soft carpet of leaves, and smell the sweet moisture in the
air, he knew that he must still be dreaming, for angels are not of this earth.

Then a strong kind hand touched his wrist, and felt the beating of his heart, and a rough,
pleasant voice said in English: "He is exhausted and very weak, but the fever is not high:
he will soon be all right." And to add to the wonderful strangeness of his dream, the angel's
voice near him murmured: "Thank God! thank God!"

Why should an angel thank God that he--Bobby Clyffurde--was not likely to die?

He opened his eyes to see what it all meant, and he saw--bending over him--a face that was
more exquisitely fair than any that man had ever seen: eyes that were more blue than the sky
above, lips that trembled like rose-leaves in the breeze. He was still dreaming and there was
a haze between him and that perfect vision of loveliness. And the kind, rough voice somewhere
close by said: "Have you got that stretcher ready?" and two other voices replied, "Yes, Sir."

But the lips close above him said nothing, and it was Bobby now who murmured: "My love, is it you?"

"Your love for always," the dear lips replied, "nothing shall part us now. Yours for always
to bring you back to life. Yours when you will claim me--yours for life."

They lifted him onto a stretcher, and then into a carriage and a very kind face which he quickly
enough recognised as Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen's smiled very encouragingly upon him, whereupon
he could not help but ask a very pertinent question:

"Mme. la Duchesse, is all this really happening?"

"Why, yes, my good man," Madame replied; and indeed there was nothing dreamlike in her tart,
dry voice: "Crystal and I really have dragged Dr. Scott away from the bedside of innumerable
other sick and wounded men, and also from any hope of well-earned rest to-night: we have also
really brought him to a spot very accurately described by our worthy friend, St. Genis, but
where, unfortunately, you had not chosen to remain, else we had found you an hour sooner. Is
there anything else you want to know?"

"Oh, yes! Madame la Duchesse, many things," murmured Bobby. "Please go on telling me."

Madame laughed: "Well!" she said, "perhaps you would like to know that some kind of instinct,
or perhaps the hand of God guided one of our party to the place where you had gone to sleep.
You may also wish to know, that though you seem in a bad way for the present, you are going
to be nursed back to life under Dr. Scott's own most hospitable roof: but since Crystal has
undertaken to do the nursing, I imagine that my time for the next six weeks will be taken up
in arguing with my dear and pompous brother that he will now have to give his consent to his
daughter becoming the wife of a vendor of gloves."

Bobby contrived to smile: "Do you think that if I promised never to buy or sell gloves again,
but in future to try and live like a gentleman--do you think then that he will consent?"

"I think, my dear boy," said Madame, subduing her harsh voice to tones of gentleness, "that
after my brother knows all that I know and all that his daughter desires, he will be proud
to welcome you as his son."

The doctor's wide barouche lumbered slowly along the wide, straight road. In the east the luminous
veil that still hid the rising sun had taken on a hue of rosy gold: the birds, now fully awake,
sang their morning hymn. From the direction of Wavre came once more the cannon's roar.

Inside the carriage Dr. Scott, sitting at the feet of his patient, gave a peremptory order
for silence. But Bobby--immeasurably happy and contented--looked up and saw Crystal de Cambray--no
longer a girl now, but a fair and beautiful woman who had learned to the last letter the fulsome
lesson of Love. She sat close beside him, and her arm was round his reclining head, and, looking
at her, he saw the lovelight in her dear eyes whenever she turned them on him. And anon, when
Mme. la Duchesse engaged Dr. Scott in a close and heated argument, Bobby felt sweet-scented
lips pressed against his own.
